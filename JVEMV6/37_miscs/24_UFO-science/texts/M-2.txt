Among those who pondered the enigma of the Michelson-Morley experiment was a young patent office examiner in Berne,
 named Albert Einstein.
 In 1905,
 when he was just twenty-six years old,
 he published a short paper suggesting an answer to the riddle in terms that opened up a new world of physical thought.
 He began by rejecting the ether theory and with it the whole idea of space as a fixed system or framework,
 absolutely at rest,
 within which it is possible to distinguish absolute from relative motion.
 The one indisputable fact established by the Michelson-Morley experiment was that the velocity of light in unaffected by the motion of the earth.

 Einstein seized on this as a revelation of universal law.
 If the velocity of light is constant regardless of the earth’s motion,
 he reasoned,
 it must be constant regardless of motion of any Sun,
 moon,
 star,
 meteor,
 or other syatem moving anywhere in universe.
 
 
 From this he drew a broader generalization,
 and asserted that the laws of nature are the same for alls uniformly moving system.
 This simple statement is the essence of Einstein’s Special theory of Relativity.
 It incorporates the Galilean Relativity Principle which states that mechanical laws are the same for all uniformly moving systems.
 But its phrasing is more comprehensive; for Einstein was thinking not only of mechanical laws laws but of the laws governing light and other electromagnetic phenomena.
 So he lumped them together in one fundamental postulate: all the phenomena of nature,
 all the law of nature,
 are the same for all systems that move uniformly relative to one another"
 
-------------------
 The ether was thought to be a backdrop at a state of absolute rest against which the movement of elements of the cosmos occurred.
 In his articles in 1905 Einstein didn't really fully rejected the existence of Ether.
 He only suggested a mathematical treatment of some relativistic problems.
 In 1920,
 after he developed the General relativity,
 he arrived to the conclusion that the ether should exist.
 This fact is of enormous importance,
 when citing the contributions of Albert Einstein.
 The Einstein statement from 1920 is missing in the scholar physics textbooks,
 where only his articles from 1905 are mentioned.

 Ether & Relativity - by Albert Einstein - University of Leiden - 5 May 1920:

 

"The ether of the general theory of relativity is a medium which is itself devoid of all mechanical and kinematical qualities,
 but helps to determine mechanical (and electromagnetic) events.
"

 

Albert Einstein in 1920:

 

“To deny ether is ultimately to assume that empty space has no physical quality whatever.
 The fundamental facts of quantum mechanics do not harmonize with this view.
