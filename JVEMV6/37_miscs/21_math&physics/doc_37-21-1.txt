Green’s functions provide a powerful tool to solve linear problems consisting of a
differential equation (partial or ordinary

 with

 possibly

 an inhomogeneous term) and
enough initial- and/or boundary conditions (also possibly inhomogeneous) so that this
problem has a unique solution

 The Green’s function is defined by a similar problem
where all initial- and/or boundary conditions are homogeneous and the inhomogeneous
term in the differential equation is a delta function

 If one knows the Green’s function
of a problem one can write down its solution in closed form as linear combinations
of integrals involving the Green’s function and the functions appearing in the inhomogeneities

 Green’s functions can often be found in an explicit way

 and in these cases
it is very efficient to solve the problem in this way
