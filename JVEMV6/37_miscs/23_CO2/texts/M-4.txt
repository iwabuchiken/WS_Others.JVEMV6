Scientists have developed the first low-cost system for splitting carbon dioxide into carbon monoxide and oxygen - a process that's crucial if we're going to ramp up renewable energy use in the future.



This splitting process has long been identified as a promising way of turning renewables into fuel without increasing the levels of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere,
 but until now,
 no one had come up with a method that was cheap enough to be practical.


The solution devised by a team from the École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne (EPFL) in Switzerland is based on an electrolysis technique using copper-oxide nanowires modified with tin oxide,
 which splits CO2 with an efficiency of 13.4 percent running on solar power.


"The work sets a new benchmark for solar-driven CO2 reduction,
" says one of the researchers,
 Jingshan Luo.


To understand why this is so important for a cleaner environment,
 we need to go back to basics,
 and the idea that splitting harmful carbon dioxide into its essential parts is good for the planet,
 as CO2 levels in the atmosphere increase.


The unfortunate catch is that such a split requires energy – and if the ultimate aim is less CO2, that energy needs to be provided by a source that doesn't generate more of it.
