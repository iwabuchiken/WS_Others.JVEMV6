Defects in nanosilica catalytically convert CO2 to methane without any metal and ligand


Significance
Reducing the CO2 levels in Earth’s atmosphere is key to stop further environmental degradation.

 CO2 conversion to methane (green fuel) using renewable hydrogen is considered as one of the best options with great potential for simultaneously resolving energy and environmental challenges,

 although the production of hydrogen from renewable resources also needs to be economically viable.

 Unfortunately,

 this process needs an expensive metal or complex organometallics and most of them suffer from instability and poor selectivity toward methane.

 In this work,

 using the %defect engineering% approach,

 we develop metal-free–ligand-free nanocatalysts,

 which convert CO2 to methane at the significant rates,

 scales,

 and stabilities.



Abstract
Active and stable metal-free heterogeneous catalysts for CO2 fixation are required to reduce the current high level of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere,

 which is driving climate change.

 In this work,

 we show that defects in %nanosilica% (E′ centers,

 oxygen vacancies,

 and nonbridging oxygen hole centers) convert CO2 to methane with excellent productivity and selectivity.

 Neither metal nor complex organic ligands were required,

 and the defect alone acted as catalytic sites for carbon dioxide activation and hydrogen dissociation and their cooperative action converted CO2 to methane.

 Unlike metal catalysts,

 which become deactivated with time,

 the defect-containing nanosilica showed significantly better stability.

 Notably,

 the catalyst can be regenerated by simple heating in the air without the need for hydrogen gas.

 Surprisingly,

 the catalytic activity for methane production increased significantly after every regeneration cycle,

 reaching more than double the methane production rate after eight regeneration cycles.

 This activated catalyst remained stable for more than 200 h.

 Detailed understanding of the role of the various defect sites in terms of their concentrations and proximities as well as their cooperativity in activating CO2 and dissociating hydrogen to produce methane was achieved.
