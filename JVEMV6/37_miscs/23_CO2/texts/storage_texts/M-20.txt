#1	Solar thermochemical splitting of CO2

#2
I should say this is a very interesting topic and I have the same idea a few years ago.

 However,

 but now I think it would be better to split CO2 to CO and O2, rather than carbon and O2. You may find in catalysis reactions,

 once solid product is involved,

 the reaction may turn into a disaster due to the transportation problems,

 that is why CO may be better and recently I have read a paper just published recently doing this thing with photocatalysis,

 simply Google to find the paper,

 sorry I can't remember the paper details.

 
 Targeting carbon as product is not a good idea,

 one good example is decomposition of CH4 to get H2, lots of efforts has to be done to separate carbon from the catalyst.

#3 CO2 based F-T synthesis

The following reaction ― known as %'Sabatier' reaction% ― looks particularly interesting (i): CO2 + 4 H2 → CH4 + 2 H2O.

 It can be coupled with water-splitting into its H2 and O2 components (ii): 4 H2O → 4 H2 + 2 O2. The net result of adding both reactions is (iii): CO2 + 2 H2O → CH4 + 2 O2. Although trying to mimic mother nature by efficiently splitting water by photolysis (harvesting sunlight energy) still seems quite challenging for today's current technology; use of electrolysis combined with photovoltaic solar cells,

 brings water-splitting rather amenable by present-day technology.

 More effort seems needed to develop the 'Sabatier' reaction process technologically,

 and to conveniently integrate both processes.


#4.1 
Also interesting is that,

 from sea water,

 Cl2 and NaOH can be produced from the dissolved salt,

 by the %chlor-alkali process%.

 It is possible to capture CO by promoting its reaction with NaOH,

 to generate sodium formate (iv): CO + NaOH → HCOONa.

 The last can be decomposed (by heating) into sodium oxalate and H2 (v): 2 HCOONa → (COO)2Na2 + H2. The net result from last reactions can be given as (vi): 2 CO + 2 NaOH → (COO)2Na2 + H2.

Use the concentrated sunlight to split CO2 in to CO and O2 - solar thermochemical CO2 splitting. You can find this pioneering work done by Steinfeld A' group from ETH.(Science, 2010, 330, 1797-1801)
