In terms of material and energy balances, mineral carbonation can be schematized as illustrated in Figure 7.1, which applies to a power plant with CO2  capture and subsequent storage through mineral carbonation.With respect to the same scheme for a power plant with capture and either geological or ocean storage (see Figure 1.4) two differences can be observed.First, there is an additional material flux corresponding to the metal oxide bearing materials; this is present as input and also as output, in the form of carbonates, silica, non-reacted minerals and for some input minerals product water.Secondly, for the same usable energy output, the relative amounts of fossil fuels as input and of energy rejected as lower grade heat are different.In-situ carbonation is an operation similar to geological storage, while ex-situ carbonation involves processing steps requiring additional energy input that are difficult to compensate for with the energy released by the carbonation reaction.Given the similarities of in-situ carbonation with geological storage, this chapter will focus on ex-situ mineral carbonation.With present technology there is always a net demand for high grade energy to drive the mineral carbonation process that is needed for: (i) the preparation of the solid reactants, including mining, transport, grinding and activation when necessary; (ii) the processing, including the equivalent energy associated with the use, recycling and possible losses of additives and catalysts; (iii) the disposal of carbonates and byproducts.The relative importance of the three items differs depending on the source of the metal oxides, for example whether they are natural silicates or industrial wastes.
