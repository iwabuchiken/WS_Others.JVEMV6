Anjos et al.(2013) obtained a lipid concentration of approximately 10% (w w−1) in Chlorella biomass when exposed to 6% CO2. According to the authors, the cultivation conditions did not cause cellular stress in microalga, justifying the relatively low value of this macromolecule in the biomass.The same phenomenon may have occurred in this study, so that the lipid concentration in the experiments with industrial wastes, with the exception of assay 2, were identical (p > 0.10) to the control (approximately 15.1% w w−1) (Table 3).
Kao et al.(2014) cultivated Chlorella sp.for 7 d with fuel from flue gas, containing approximately 24% CO2, 15–20 ppm SO2 and 25–30 ppm NOx (a mixture of NO and NO2).These authors found 33.8 ± 0.5% lipid in the Chlorella sp.biomass, approximately 2-fold more than the amount obtained in this study.According to Chiu et al.(2008), concentrations above 10% of CO2 in cultures can cause cellular stress and inhibition of microalgal growth.Under these conditions, the microorganisms produce a higher amount of lipid macromolecules.Among the possible applications of the lipid fraction of C.fusca LEB 111 biomass, the production of biodiesel stands out.The advantages of obtaining this biofuel from microalgae are the high productivity, combined with a significant amount of triglyceride accumulation (Scott et al., 2010).
In cultures using industrial wastes, the highest (p < 0.10) protein concentrations (50.8 ± 0.6%, w w−1; 50.5 ± 1.3%, w w−1 and 52.3 ± 0.6%, w w−1) were obtained in the experiments that had the maximum rates and efficiencies of CO2 biofixation (Assays 1, 2 and 5, respectively).The C.fusca LEB 111 experiments were also terminated in the exponential cell growth phase.The enhancement of cell multiplication during this phase causes increased protein production by the cells, which are synthesized from CO2 biofixation in the Calvin cycle, which explains the results.These macromolecules have multiple functions in cells and are responsible for their growth and maintenance, as well as their regulation of cellular activities, in addition to other purposes (Solomon et al., 1999).
