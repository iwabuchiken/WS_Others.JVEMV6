The American Friends of Yeshivat HaRa’ayon HaYehudi directly supports Yeshivat HaRa’ayon HaYehudi or the Jewish Idea Yeshiva, a Jewish education institution founded by Kahane.
“This is sort of the place for indoctrination of Kahanist ideology,” HaBloc said.“It’s where Benzi Gopstein studied and other prominent Kahanist figures.” 
The charity gave $154,000 to Yeshivat HaRa’ayon HaYehudi in 2018, according to the most recent tax report.The yeshiva is even classified as a terrorist organization by the United States.The yeshiva’s dean, Rabbi Yehuda Kroizer, is also part of Chasdei Meir.The yeshiva did not return a request for comment.
The nonprofits’ tax filings list Levi Chazan as the director of Charity of Light and American Friends of Yeshivat HaRa’ayon HaYehudi, and Steven Goldrich is listed as a director of Charity of Light and treasurer of American Friends of Yeshivat HaRa’ayon HaYehudi.Chazan was convicted in a 1984 bus shooting in the Occupied West Bank, which wounded seven Palestinians.Both did not respond to requests for comment.
HaBloc explained this entanglement of Israeli and American organizations is not directly supporting Lehava with monetary contributions, but rather aiding the network around it.
“The relationship between [Lehava] and groups that are funded with American money are two separate issues,” HaBloc’s Cohen said.“There are connections, of course, but we cannot say that these groups that were active in the last two weeks were funded with American dollars.”
