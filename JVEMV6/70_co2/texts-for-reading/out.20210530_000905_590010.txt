Subsequent research, including interviews with indigenous leaders from the area, has revealed that the PBS Newshour report was fundamentally inaccurate.Journalist John Perry, based in Nicaragua, gives details in his article “Progressive Media Promoted a False Story of Conflict Beef from Nicaragua,” published by Fairness and Accuracy In Reporting.Some of the reported violence was exaggerated, and some entirely fabricated.The claims of “genocide,” it turns out, are not credible.
The exaggerated and false accusations in the PBS report were based on four sources.Lottie Cunningham is an indigenous attorney who heads up the Center for Justice and Human Rights on the Atlantic Coast of Nicaragua (CEJUDHCAN).Her organization is a USAID recipient, and she is close to the U.S.ambassador to Nicaragua.The United Nations Human Rights Commission has issued press releases based solely on her accusations.Judging by the “Conflict Beef” report, her accusations are sometimes exaggerated and sometimes untrue.
Another source for this report was Anuradha Mittal of the Oakland Institute, which received a grant of nearly a quarter of a million dollars for its research on Nicaraguan “land conflict.” Much of the information came from the Oakland Institute report and the claims of Cunningham, a USAID grant recipient, as noted, and recipient of the Lush Spring Prize sponsored by Lush Cosmetics.
The chart below portrays these and other ideological and financial connections implicated in the generation of the PBS Newshour report.
