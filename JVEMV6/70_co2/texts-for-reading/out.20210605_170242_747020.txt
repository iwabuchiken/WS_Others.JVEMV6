It is important to note the cell potentials listed in the table above.They range between 1.85 V to 4.95 V, compared to the 1.6 V to 2.2 V often used in water electrolysis [A12].The potential is higher for three typical reasons.First, all of the processes listed above still require the electrolysis of water to occur in parallel to CO2 reduction.Second, additional power must then be consumed to drive the resulting reduction.Finally, the cells used were generally of an inefficient design.Efficient industrial cells are designed to minimize the spacing between the electrodes and membrane as much as possible.Increased spacing results in more current having to pass through the solution, which has a higher resistance that the electrical circuit.This results in the need to apply a much larger potential, which in turn increases the energy required.Since hydrogen can be produced more efficiently in a standard water electrolysis cell it is viewed as an undesired byproduct here, as it increases the power consumption of the cell.
