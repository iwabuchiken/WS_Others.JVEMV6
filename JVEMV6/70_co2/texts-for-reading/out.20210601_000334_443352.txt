Kahanism’s surge in IsraelKahane’s Kach Party was banned from entering Israeli politics in 1988. But thanks to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, Kahanists are now infiltrating the halls of the Knesset (Israeli parliament).In the lead-up to Israel’s March election, Netanyahu pushed for a right-wing alliance with Itamar Ben-Gvir, a Kahanist, a defense lawyer for price tag campaigners, and leader of the far-right Otzma Yehudit (Jewish Power) party.Otzma Yehudit partnered with the anti-LGBTQ Noam Party and the National Union-Tkuma faction to form the Religious Zionism bloc in the last election.The coalition allowed the electoral list to secure six seats in the Knesset and for a Kahanist to gain political power.Rabbi Sattath pins the blame squarely on Netanyahu for Jewish supremacists’ rise in government.“Because the prime minister was in such a dire situation and was desperate for every vote, he gave [Otzma Yehudit] the legitimacy,” Rabbi Sattath said.“What we’re seeing here in Israel and around the world is that one of the symptoms of democracies in decline is when the extreme right takes over the center right.The fact that the prime minister and some of the right-wing parties gave the Jewish Power Party legitimacy has then increased their power.And that’s what enabled them to use these methods they’ve used for over a decade on a large scale in the last wave of violence.”
