The use of microalga from a power plant, linked to the intermittent wastes injection in the culture, enabled Chlorella growth under all conditions.The addition of ash (40 ppm), SO2 and NO (until 400 ppm) to cultivations did not markedly affect CO2 biofixation by microalga.The best CO2 biofixation efficiency was obtained with 10% CO2, 200 ppm SO2 and NO and 40 ppm ash (50.0 ± 0.8%), showing a specific growth rate of 0.18 ± 0.01 d−1. The biomass composition presented around 19.7% carbohydrates, 15.5% lipids and 50.2% proteins.
