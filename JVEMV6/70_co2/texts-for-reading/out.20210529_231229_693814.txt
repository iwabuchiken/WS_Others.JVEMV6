Saab’s distinguished African defense team 
Saab’s attorney in Cabo Verde, Geraldo da Cruz Almeida, explained to the webinar the absurdity of the politically motivated legal case against his client: Alex Saab has violated neither Cabo Verdean nor Venezuelan law.Moreover, Saab’s diplomatic status should have given him immunity from arrest.
The U.S.does not recognize Saab’s diplomatic status.But then again, President Joe Biden maintains the fiction that the self-appointed and Trump-anointed Juan Guaidó is president of Venezuela.
Femi Falana, former president of the West African Bar Association, spoke to the webinar from Nigeria.Attorney Falana represented Saab before the regional Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) Court.On March 15, the court ordered Saab’s release and cancellation of the extradition.
Under U.S.pressure, Cabo Verde continues to hold Saab.Attorney Falana has called on President Biden to respect the rule of law and human rights in Africa.Sara Flounders of the International Action Center pointed out that 15 of the 39 countries under illegal U.S.sanctions are African.
