AG: And that was the subject of one of your other books, “Fool's Crusade,” right? Could you remind us of the full title?  
DJ:  Fool’s Crusade: Yugoslavia, NATO and Western Delusions .The United States did everything to promote that war and used it to transform NATO into an offensive rather than defensive force.
AG: I think the Canadian Greens share the German Greens’ commitment to “R2P,” the doctrine that we have the “Responsibility to Protect,” to intervene, aka go to war, to stop genocide.Does this leave the US Greens as the only radical Greens in the world? 
DJ: Well, I think it probably does.And there are reasons for that.And if I may be a bit cynical, one reason for that is that there is no possibility of coalition government in the United States system.It's a two-party system.So the American Greens are innocent of even any temptation to be in power.There's no way for them to sell out because nobody will buy them; there's no coalition that they could enter into. 
Germany is a coalition government.So if you compromise here and compromise there, you may manage to get into government.That's how Scott Fisher, who began as an uneducated leftist streetfighter, became the German Foreign Minister with American approval.The Americans knew that he would do just what he did, which was to transform the German Greens into a war party.In the United States, no Green has ever been tempted to become a foreign minister because the Greens aren’t a peace party so threatening to the system that they can sell out.The American Greens are too marginal.
