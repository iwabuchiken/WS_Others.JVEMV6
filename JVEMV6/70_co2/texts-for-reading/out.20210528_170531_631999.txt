This chapter deals with: (i) the fixation of CO2  in the form of inorganic carbonates, also known as ‘mineral carbonation’ or ‘mineral sequestration’ that is discussed in Section 7.2, and (ii) the industrial uses of CO2 as a technical fluid or as feedstock for carbon containing chemicals, which is the subject of Section 7.3.7.2 Mineral carbonation 7.2.1	 Definitions, system boundaries and motivation Mineral carbonation is based on the reaction of CO2  with metal oxide bearing materials to form insoluble carbonates, with calcium and magnesium being the most attractive metals.In nature such a reaction is called silicate weathering and takes place on a geological time scale.It involves naturally occurring silicates as the source of alkaline and alkaline-earth metals and consumes atmospheric CO2 . This chapter deals, however, with so-called mineral carbonation, where high concentration CO2 from a capture step (see Chapter 3) is brought into contact with metal oxide bearing materials with the purpose of fixing the CO2 as carbonates (Seifritz, 1990; Dunsmore, 1992; Lackner et al., 1995).Suitable materials may be abundant silicate rocks, serpentine and olivine minerals for example, or on a smallerscale alkaline industrial residues, such as slag from steel production or fly ash.In the case of silicate rocks, carbonation can be carried out either ex-situ in a chemical processing plant after mining and pretreating the silicates, or in-situ, by injecting CO2  in silicate-rich geological formations or in alkaline aquifers.Industrial residues on the other hand can be carbonated in the same plant where they are produced.It is worth noting that products of in-situ mineral carbonation and geological storage may be similar for the fraction of the CO2  injected for geological storage that reacts with the alkaline or alkaline-earth metals in the cap rock leading to ‘mineral trapping’ (see Chapter 5.2.2).
