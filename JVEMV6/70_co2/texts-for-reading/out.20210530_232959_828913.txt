DJ: Well, yes, but that's not the whole story.Of course that's the economic motive.But I think the main motive is political hegemony because the United States uses Europe as its excuse to be the head of the international community.And you have to realize that the United States is now running a real offensive to, I think, overthrow the government of Russia.They make up every possible excuse to separate Western Europe from Russia.And part of this is not just to sell Europe more gas and whatever, but also to destabilize Russia, make Russia collapse so that the United States can run Russia the way it did with Yeltsin.In the 1990s, when the drunken Yeltsin was in power, the United States was pretty much dictating to Russia,  and they enjoyed that so much that they want to get it back. 
They have never forgiven Putin for reviving a bit of Russian independence and it’s that Russian independence that they really can't stand.And of course, they portray that as Russian aggression when it’s really US aggression.There's a real, all-out campaign against Russia.And the United States is using its European allies against Russia. 
AG: What would be the penalty to Europeans if they refused to comply? 
DJ: Well, that isn’t even the issue.I think people don't realize the extent of which Germany in particular has quite literally been a militarily occupied country since 1945. The United States occupies Germany, Italy, and some others that don’t matter quite so much like Belgium, militarily.They have huge bases there.They have nuclear weapons there.They have bombers there that could fly over and bomb Russia from Western Europe.  
France managed to get NATO out of the country back in the 1960s, so France is a little less militarily occupied, but the United States treats all of Western Europe like occupied countries.Psychologically, It works.The leadership is just so used to the United States being in charge.
