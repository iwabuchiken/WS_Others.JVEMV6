Cell protein concentrations tend to rise when the amount of nitrogen in the culture medium is high.However, Table 3 shows that C.fusca LEB 111 showed no increase in the protein quantity when cultivated at the highest NO concentration (assay 4, 47.9 ± 1.2%, w w−1) resulting in lower protein concentration (p > 0.10) than in the control experiment.The proteins present in C.fusca LEB 111 biomass may be used in the pharmaceutical industry for the production of biofilms, emulsifiers, in addition to other applications.
