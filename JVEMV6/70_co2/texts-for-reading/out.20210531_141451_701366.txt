Most processes under consideration for mineral carbonation focus on metal oxide bearing material that contains alkaline-earth metals (such as calcium and magnesium) as opposed to alkali metals (such as sodium and potassium) whose corresponding carbonates are very soluble in water.Oxides and hydroxides of calcium and magnesium would be the ideal source materials, but because of their reactivity they are also extremely rare in nature.Therefore, suitable metal oxide bearing minerals may be silicate rocks or alkaline industrial residues, the former being abundant but generally difficult to access and the latter scarcer but easily available.	 Among silicate rocks, mafic and ultramafic rocks are rocks that contain high amounts of magnesium, calcium and iron and have a low content of sodium and potassium.Some of their main mineral constituents are olivines, serpentine, enstatite (MgSiO3 ), talc (Mg3 Si4 O10(OH)2 ) and wollastonite.Although molar abundances of magnesium and calcium silicates in the Earthâ€™s crust are similar, rocks containing magnesium silicate exhibit a higher MgO concentration (up to 50% by weight, corresponding to a theoretical CO2 storage capacity of 0.55 kg CO2 /kg rock), than rocks containing calcium silicates, for example basalts, that haveCaO content of about 10% by weight only (with a theoretical CO2 storage capacity of 0.08 kg CO2 /kgrock) (Goff and Lackner, 1998).Deposits of wollastonite, the most calcium-rich silicate, are much rarer than those of magnesium-rich silicates.
