AG: In your latest piece for Consortium News, Washington’s Green Branches in Europe , you portray Europe more or less as an American colony.
DJ: Well, I'm afraid it is.I have spent the last 50 years here, hoping that Europe would stand up against American imperialism.But in fact, year by year, that hope dwindles more rapidly.Oddly enough, Europe is now more subjugated than ever.And part of it is because they made Trump out to be such a monster and now Biden is back! Oh, wonderful! The European press can’t stop applauding.How great America is back! The moment when you thought maybe the Europeans disliked Trump so much that they might take an independent stance has passed. 
AG: And the US wants Europe, Germany in this case in particular, to buy their fracked, natural gas condensed into LNG, then shipped across the Atlantic, and very dangerously decondensed, right?
