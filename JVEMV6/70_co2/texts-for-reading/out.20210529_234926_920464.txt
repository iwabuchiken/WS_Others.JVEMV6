There is much truth in the old saying, “He who pays the piper, calls the tune,” and the neoliberal era has spawned individuals with incredible wealth who, through “philanthropy,” can feel good and flex their influence at the same time.While these philanthropists can be liberal on some issues, they almost universally support U.S.foreign policy and the “free market;” and, because many of these super-rich individuals made their wealth through investments and speculation, most do not like a planned economy, socialized services beyond the private sector, or greater government control.
These mega-wealthy individuals and the people who run their foundations are often intricately connected to the U.S.foreign policy establishment.Grants are given to projects, campaigns, and organizations that align with their long-term goals.In this direct way, supposedly independent think tanks and NGOs are influenced, if outright not controlled.
