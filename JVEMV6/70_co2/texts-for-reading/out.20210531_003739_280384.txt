Much of what is called the “left” still insists that the American “revolution” of 1776 is “unfinished,” when history shows that white supremacy was the intended result.
“Those who consider themselves to be sophisticated refer to an ‘Incomplete Revolution,’ as if the founders had in mind ‘others’ not defined as ‘white’ but, perhaps, forgot to include them.” 
In “The White Republic and The Struggle for Racial Justice,” Bob Wing contended that the U.S.state is racist to the core, and this has specific implications for our movements’ work going forward, especially the need to replace this racist state with an anti-racist state.Organizing Upgrade is publishing a series of commentaries on this piece, and we invite readers to respond as well.In this installment, Gerald Horne argues that we must reckon with the dynamics of settler colonialism if we are to understand white supremacy.“The attempt to build ‘class unity’ without confronting these underlying tensions often has meant coercing oppressed nationalities—Blacks in the first place—to co-sign a kind of ‘left wing white nationalism,’ Horne writes.
The good news is that Comrade Bob Wing’s analysis represents a step forward in terms of the U.S.Left’s understanding of the nation—“republic”—in which it struggles.
The bad news is that the U.S.left has not necessarily kept pace with the U.S.ruling class in terms of similar issues, or even with non-radical African-Americans, for that matter.
Consider the multi-part series on HBO Max (a member in good standing of the much reviled “corporate media”) that premiered recently, i.e.Black filmmaker Raoul Peck’s “Exterminate All the Brutes,” a sweeping analysis and condemnation of settler colonialism (a term curiously absent from ordinary discourse on the left) and white supremacy. His other credits include the superb docu-drama “The Young Karl Marx.”
