The only people who tend to object to US dominance are the far right.And of course the far right are horrible monsters.We mustn’t have anything to do with the far right, because of Hitler.Everytime someone appears on the far right, they might become Hitler.So the left easily goes along with US hegemony because it's against the right—which might become Hitler—especially when the Democrats are in power there.
AG: How did this happen to the German and French Green Parties? And has it happened to other European Green Parties as well? 
DJ: Well, the other Green Parties aren’t as significant as the German Green Party.And sorry, but to try and explain how this happened, I have to put in a plug for my book, Circle in the Darkness.  
AG: Please do.I'll put in a plug too.Read Diana’s memoir, “Circle in the Darkness: Memoir of a World Watcher .”  .highly recommend it. 
DJ: I explained what’s happened to the European left during the past 50 years as well as I could in my book. And in particular, what happened to the Greens because I worked for the Greens in the European Parliament for four, five, six, seven years.And I recount stages in the transformation of the German Greens from the main peace party to the main war party.I saw this happening and it's a rather long story, but that is what has happened. 
And the key moment was the 1999 bombing, the NATO bombing of Yugoslavia, when a German foreign minister from the Greens took both Germany and his party into that war.He directly  transformed the Greens into a party championing war for the sake of human rights, much like Samantha Power.
