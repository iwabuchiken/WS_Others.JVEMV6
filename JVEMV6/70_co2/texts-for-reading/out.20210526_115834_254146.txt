The WHO had to suspend its crucial aid to about 10,000 healthcare workers across conflict-hit Yemen in November last year because of a “financial gap.”“Due to an unprecedented financial gap, WHO & health partners have been unable to continue their financial support to the health care workforce in Yemen.Up to 10K health workers are affected,” the WHO's Yemen office tweeted at the time.In April 2020, the administration of former US President Donald Trump moved to withhold $400 million in financial aid from the WHO, accusing it of mismanaging the coronavirus pandemic and being too trusting of China.However, the Joe Biden administration has resumed working with the UN organization.The WHO’s funding shortfalls come amid widespread reports that wealthier countries, including the United States, are hoarding millions of doses of COVID-19 vaccines, a practice that international health experts say is undermining the global response to the pandemic. Amnesty International condemned wealthier countries last month for failing a “rudimentary” test of global unity by stockpiling vaccines.
