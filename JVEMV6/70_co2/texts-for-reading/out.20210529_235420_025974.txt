U.S.meddling in Nicaragua is thinly veiled behind the U.S.-funded “civil society,” a “new generation of democratic leaders,” and an “ecosystem of independent media.” In September 2016, a high USAID official told the House Foreign Affairs Committee that 2,200 Nicaraguan youth had received leadership training.The U.S.governmental hypocrisy has been quite astounding.Imagine if Nicaragua, or Russia, or any other country for that matter, trained thousands of U.S.activists to “promote democracy” in the United States! 
In December 2018, the U.S.ratified the “Nicaragua Human Rights and Anticorruption Act,” which imposes sanctions and commits the U.S.to prevent Nicaragua from receiving a loan, financial or technical assistance from U.S.-dominated financial institutions.
In August 2020, details emerged of a new USAID “task order” called Responsive Assistance in Nicaragua (RAIN).The document “outlines plans for a U.S.regime-change scheme against Nicaragua’s elected leftist government.”  In short, Washington is not just hostile but actively trying to undermine, destabilize and replace the Sandinista administration.
