The protests of last summer, spurred by the police killing of George Floyd pushed Black Lives Matter to the center of U.S.political discourse, transforming it from a controversial movement (in the eyes of some) to a mainstream political force that was impossible to ignore.Major corporations, celebrities, and universities that might have been silent before were proudly displaying their support for the phrase and the movement behind it.
In Palestine, too, George Floyd’s killing had an impact on the relationship between these two movements.For example, George Floyd’s image was painted  on the separation barrier built around the occupied West Bank.After the fatal Israeli police killing of Eyad al-Hallaq, an unarmed Palestinian man, in Jerusalem, protesters in Palestine held up posters with al-Hallaq’s image next to that of George Floyd’s, bearing the slogan , “From the USA to Palestine… Racism is a crime.
The conversation and following generated in this moment have persisted.Black Lives Matter’s official Twitter handle has  more than 1 million  followers, and vocal activists around prison abolition and defunding the police also have followers numbering in the  hundreds of thousands to  millions .These same organizations and activists have come out to strongly support the Palestinian people in the face of oppression at the hands of the Israeli state.The official Black Lives Matter movement—which even last summer was generating international solidarity uniting anti-racist movements across the world—has amplified calls for the U.S.government to stop Israeli human rights abuses.Many of the activists who gained prominence over the past year have stated unequivocally  that silence about Palestine is akin to silence over racial injustice in the United States.
