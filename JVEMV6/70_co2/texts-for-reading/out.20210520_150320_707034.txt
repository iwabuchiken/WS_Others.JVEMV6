ABSTRACT Removal and long-term storage of the greenhouse gas CO2 from flue gases from fossilfuel-fired  power  plants  and  utilities  may  be  accomplished  by  mineral  carbonation. Since  vastresources of suitable magnesium-based minerals silicates such as serpentine (Mg3Si2O5(OH)4) appearto  exist  in  Finland,  this  option  could  support  Finland’s  commitments  under  the  1997  KyotoProtocol. This  paper  assesses  direct,  dry  mineral  carbonation  for  CO2  sequestration. Finland’smineral  resources  and  their  quality  are  discussed,  and  chemical  kinetics  studies  addressing  theinfluence of gas composition, mineral composition and catalysts are reported.Finally, some practicalimplications of CO2 sequestration by mineral carbonation are addressed.Key  words:  carbon  dioxide,  emission  reduction,  reaction  kinetics,  geochemistry,  ultramafic  rocks,Finland, waste disposal.
