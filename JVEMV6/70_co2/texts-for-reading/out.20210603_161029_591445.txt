The Methanol to Hydrocarbons process was discovered at Mobil Oil in 1977. This process is used to convert methanol to products such as olefins and gasoline.The methanol can first be obtained from coal or natural gas.In the Methanol to Olefins (MTO) process, the methanol is then converted to olefins such as ethylene and propylene.The olefins can be reacted to produce polyolefins, which are used to make many plastic materials.An MTO process flow diagram advertised by Honeywell is shown below.Process flow diagram for an MTO process advertised by Honeywell CorporationCritical to the successful application of the MTO process are acidic zeolite catalysts, which are discussed in detail on the zeolites page.Without these catalysts, the chemical reactions involved in the MTO process would be too slow for the process to be economically feasible.
