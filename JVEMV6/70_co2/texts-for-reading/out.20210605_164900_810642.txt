The anode electrolyte and electrode would mimic those already in use for water electrolysis.For the cathode the electrode and electrolyte compositions vary depending on the desired products.We have chosen to focus on production of methanol, methane, and syngas as our primary fuels.These can readily be utilized in the existing fuel infrastructure, assuming the syn-gas has been processed into a fuel such as diesel.The operating conditions have been chosen based on some of the most promising results that were found out the literature investigated and can be seen in the table below.It should be noted that the total efficiencies tend to fall less than 100%.This generally occurred for two reasons.The first was due to resistive losses in the cell, where the electricity was dissipated as heat.The second reason was that many experiments only analyzed select products, meaning that certain products were left unaccounted.Methane production was based off results from Kanaco et al., where copper was used for the cathode electrode catalyst and LiI in methanol for the electrolyte [A13].Syn-gas production was modeled based on Yamamoto et al.using a carbon fiber/Ni gas diffusion electrode (GDE), where no liquid electrolyte was present in the cathode [A14].Two different results were modeled for methanol production, both using an aqueous KHCO3 electrolyte solution.Bandi et al.[A15] obtained results at a larger current density using Ru/Ti oxides for the catalyst, while Kobayashi et al.[A16] obtained a much higher efficiency using a Cu/Zn/Al alloy, though at considerably lower current densities.The majority of these catalyst materials would be cheaper than the noble metals, such as Pt, found in PEM electrolyzers, and would be about as expensive as the more common metals, such as Ni, used in alkaline electrolysis.
