The physical makeup of the electrochemical would be very similar to existing alkaline and proton exchange membrane (PEM) water electrolysis cells used for the production of hydrogen gas.Alkaline electrolysis uses a basic electrolyte solution in both the anode and cathode.Oxygen gas is produced at the anode, and hydroxide ions pass through the membrane into the cathode, where the ions combine to form hydrogen gas and water.The membrane is usually a porous inert material that allows the passage of electrolyte, but not the gaseous products.In a PEM electrolyzer the membrane is a proton conductor, where hydrogen ions are formed in the anode and combine to form hydrogen gas at the cathode.In this case the electrolyte is generally pure water.Membranes that conduct negatively charged ions also exist, though there are very few commercial products with performance on par with existing PEM technology.
