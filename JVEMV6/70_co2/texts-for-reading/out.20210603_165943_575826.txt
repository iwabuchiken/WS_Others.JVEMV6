The choice of catalyst and other conditions determine how many carbon atoms can be stitched together to make molecules or even generate longer polymers.In general, the longer the carbon chain, the more valuable the product.
The next step is to learn more about the underlying chemical reaction, so it can be used to produce other valuable products such as diols, which are widely used in the polymer industry, or hydrocarbons that can be used as renewable fuels.The researchers are designing, building, and testing electrolyzers for commercial use.
Based on their work, the researchers have earned patents for the electrocatalysts and formed RenewCOâ‚‚, a start-up company.
The research has been published in the journal Energy & Environmental Science.
