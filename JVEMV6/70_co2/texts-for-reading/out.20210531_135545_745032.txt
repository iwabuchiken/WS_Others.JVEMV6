When CO2 reacts with metal oxides (indicated here as MO,where M is a divalent metal, e.g., calcium, magnesium, or iron)the corresponding carbonate is formed and heat is releasedaccording to the following chemical reaction:The amount of heat depends on the specific metal and on thematerial containing the metal oxide.In general this is a largefraction (up to 46% in the case of calcium oxide) of the heatreleased by the upstream combustion process forming CO2(393.8 kJ mol–1CO2 for combustion of elemental carbon).In the case of a few natural silicates the following exothermicchemical reactions take place (in all cases heat values are givenper unit mol of CO2 and standard conditions 25°C and 0.1 MPa,Robie et al.1978):Since the reaction releases heat, the formation of carbonatesis thermodynamically favoured at low temperature, whereasat high temperature (above 900°C for calcium carbonate andabove 300°C for magnesium carbonate, at a CO2 partial pressureof one bar) the reverse reaction, that is calcination, is favoured.The representative member of the olivine family considered inthe first reaction above is forsterite, which is iron-free.In naturemost olivines contain some iron that can form iron oxides orsiderite (FeCO3).
