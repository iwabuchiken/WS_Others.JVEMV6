Then, solving only the constraint ]] G j = 0 {\displaystyle G_{j}=0} G_{j}=0 and determining the Dirac observables with respect to it leads us back to the Arnowitt–Deser–Misner (ADM) phase space with constraints H , C a {\displaystyle H,C_{a}} H,C_{a}.]]The dynamics of general relativity is generated by the constraints, it can be shown that six Einstein equations describing time evolution (really a gauge transformation) ]] can be obtained by calculating the Poisson brackets of the three-metric ]] and its conjugate momentum ]] with a linear combination of the spatial diffeomorphism and Hamiltonian constraint.]]The vanishing of the constraints, ]] giving the physical phase space, are the four other Einstein equations.[16] ]]
