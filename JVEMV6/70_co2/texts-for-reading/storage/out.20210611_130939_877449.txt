However, complications can arise in the many-body problem.]]Since the potential energy depends on the spatial arrangement of the particles, the kinetic energy will also depend on the spatial configuration to conserve energy.]]The motion due to any one particle will vary due to the motion of all the other particles in the system.]]For this reason cross terms for kinetic energy may appear in the Hamiltonian; a mix of the gradients for two particles: ]]    − ℏ 2 2 M ∇ i ⋅ ∇ j {\displaystyle -{\frac {\hbar ^{2}}{2M}}\nabla _{i}\cdot \nabla _{j}} -{\frac {\hbar ^{2}}{2M}}\nabla _{i}\cdot \nabla _{j} ]]where M {\displaystyle M} M denotes the mass of the collection of particles resulting in this extra kinetic energy.]]Terms of this form are known as mass polarization terms, and appear in the Hamiltonian of many electron atoms (see below).]]
