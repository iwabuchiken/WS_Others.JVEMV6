Quantum field theory on curved (non-Minkowskian) backgrounds, while not a full quantum theory of gravity, has shown many promising early results.]]In an analogous way to the development of quantum electrodynamics in the early part of the 20th century (when physicists considered quantum mechanics in classical electromagnetic fields), ]] the consideration of quantum field theory on a curved background has led to predictions such as black hole radiation.]]Phenomena such as the Unruh effect,]] in which particles exist in certain accelerating frames but not in stationary ones, do not pose any difficulty when considered on a curved background (the Unruh effect occurs even in flat Minkowskian backgrounds).]]The vacuum state is the state with the least energy (and may or may not contain particles).]]See Quantum field theory in curved spacetime for a more complete discussion.]]
