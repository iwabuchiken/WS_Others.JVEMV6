Loop quantum gravity (LQG)[1].[2].[3].[4].[5].is a theory of quantum gravity, ]] which aims to merge quantum mechanics and general relativity, incorporating matter of the Standard Model into the framework established for the pure quantum gravity case.]]As a candidate for quantum gravity, LQG competes with string theory.[6]. ]]Loop quantum gravity is an attempt to develop a quantum theory of gravity ]] based directly on Einstein's geometric formulation rather than the treatment of gravity as a force.]]To do this, in LQG theory space and time are quantized analogously to the way quantities like energy and momentum are quantized in quantum mechanics.]]The theory gives a physical picture of spacetime where space and time are granular and discrete directly because of quantization ]] just like photons in the quantum theory of electromagnetism and the discrete energy levels of atoms.]]An implication of a quantized space is that a minimum distance exists.]]
