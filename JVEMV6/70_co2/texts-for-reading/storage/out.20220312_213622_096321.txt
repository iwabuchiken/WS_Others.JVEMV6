The Israeli regime is set to build 730 new settler units in the occupied al-Quds, as part of its illegal settlement expansion activities across the Palestinian territories.
The Palestinian Information Center reported on Friday that an Israeli committee for construction and planning had approved a plan for the construction of 730 new settler units in the settlement of Pisgat Ze'ev in the occupied East al-Quds.
Citing a report by Israeli newspaper Kol Ha'ir, the PIC said the 730 units would be part of 14 twelve-story buildings that would be built in Pisgat Ze'ev.
The committee also approved two plans for the construction of 1,060 units in western al-Quds, including 850 units on Jaffa Street and 210 housing units in Kiryat Ye'arim.

Since taking over in June last year, right-wing Israeli Prime Minister Naftali Bennett has been rapidly expanding settlements in contravention of international law.Bennett has also ruled out formal peace talks with the Palestinian Authority during his tenure.
About 600,000 Israelis live in over 230 settlements built since the 1967 occupation of the Palestinian territories of the West Bank and East al-Quds.
Palestinians want the West Bank as part of a future independent Palestinian state, with East al-Quds as its capital.The last round of Israeli-Palestinian talks collapsed in 2014. Among the major sticking points in those negotiations was Israel's continued settlement expansion.
All Israeli settlements are illegal under the international law as they are built on occupied land.The UN Security Council has condemned Israel's settlement activities in several resolutions.
