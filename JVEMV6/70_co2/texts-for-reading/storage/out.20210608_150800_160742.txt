As explained above, quantum gravitational effects are extremely weak and therefore difficult to test.]]For this reason, thought experiments are becoming an important theoretical tool.]]An important aspect of quantum gravity relates to the question of the coupling of spin and spacetime.]]While spin and spacetime are expected to be coupled,[58].]]the precise nature of this coupling is currently unknown.]]In particular and most importantly, it is not known how quantum spin sources gravity and what is the correct characterization of the spacetime of a single spin-half particle.]]To analyze this question, thought experiments in the context of quantum information, have been suggested.[8].]]This work shows that, in order to avoid violation of relativistic causality, the measurable spacetime around a spin-half particle's (rest frame) must be spherically symmetric - i.e., ]] either spacetime is spherically symmetric, or somehow measurements of the spacetime (e.g., time-dilation measurements) should create ]] some sort of back action that affects and changes the quantum spin.]]
