According to the study, the risk of portal vein thrombosis (a blood clot in the liver) appears to be 30 times higher with the mRNA vaccines made by Moderna and Pfizer than with AstraZeneca’s.As well, the risk of cerebral vein thrombosis (a blood clot in the brain) appears to be quite similar with both AstraZeneca (five in a million) and those mRNA vaccines (four in a million).  
This was pretty much ignored in the media and there’s been no public outrage about this.It begs the question in both of these cases, why? There could be many reasons but I think two reasons immediately come to mind that are obviously interlinked. 
First, the Moderna and Pfizer vaccines are the only two for-profit vaccines on the market.The already-massive drug company Pfizer raked in $900 million in the first quarter of this year.Big Pharma is a massive lobby in Washington and is also a huge patron of the news media, so it’s no wonder everyone’s hushing up about any potential dangers from these vaccines.
There’s simply too much at stake for the US and its ultra-wealthy ruling class to make a fuss about these particular vaccines even though they did the same thing with other vaccines that are being sold not-for-profit.
