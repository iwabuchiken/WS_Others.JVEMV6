The Hamiltonian of a system is the sum of the kinetic energies of all the particles, plus the potential energy of the particles associated with the system.]]The Hamiltonian takes different forms and can be simplified in some cases by taking into account the concrete characteristics of the system under analysis, ]] such as single or several particles in the system, interaction between particles, kind of potential energy, time varying potential or time independent one.]]
