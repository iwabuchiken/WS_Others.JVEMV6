Pressure has also come from other sources.Pro-Israel lobby group We Believe In Israel has begun a campaign to push streaming giant Spotify to remove Lowkey’s music from its platform, disingenuously claiming that his lyrics “incite and promote hatred, violence, and disinformation against Jews and Israelis.” 
Conservative MP Robert Halfon brought up Lowkey in a parliamentary committee.“What more can be done by the [Office for Students] to prevent this type of behavior from occurring again?” he angrily demanded.Today, the matter reached the prime minister himself.
The National Union of Students’ attempts to dissipate the situation, by stating that there were always “safe spaces” for students at events, was spun by the press into the idea that Jewish people would need to be “segregated” for their own safety.When asked for comment by MintPress as to why the event was changed, the student-run union’s press team stated that the rapper was only booked to give a talk at a side symposium, rather than for a concert and an appearance at the main event.“Lowkey was due to speak at [the] Liberation Conference on 30 March.He has pulled out of the event and will no longer be appearing,” they said.However, others familiar with the matter suggested this was not the case.“It is incredibly cowardly of the NUS to cancel it in this way and then dishonestly say Lowkey has pulled out,” said Asa Winstanley, an investigative journalist at The Electronic Intifada, adding: 
    It is another example of the blatant censorship that exists in this country on the issue of Palestine.There is no other topic, over such a long period of time, other than the issue of Palestine and the Israel lobby, that there is so much danger of being censored or canceled.This pressure by the Israel lobby in this country is really disgusting and needs to end.:
