In an effective field theory,]] not all but the first few of the infinite set of parameters in a nonrenormalizable theory are suppressed by huge energy scales and hence can be neglected when computing low-energy effects.]]Thus, at least in the low-energy regime, the model is a predictive quantum field theory.[23] Furthermore, many theorists argue that the Standard Model should be regarded as an effective field theory itself, ]] with "nonrenormalizable" interactions suppressed by large energy scales and whose effects have consequently not been observed experimentally.[24] ]]By treating general relativity as an effective field theory, one can actually make legitimate predictions for quantum gravity, at least for low-energy phenomena.]]An example is the well-known calculation of the tiny first-order quantum-mechanical correction to the classical Newtonian gravitational potential between two masses.[23]
