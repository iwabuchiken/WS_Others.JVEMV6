Turkey is moving towards a turnout.Do we witness the last days of the AKP regime, or do we have harder times ahead of us? On one hand, a large mass of people is hopeful that “the AKP is falling back in the polls”, on the other hand, they are afraid that the AKP will carry out an election coup.]]Unfortunately, the force that the masses are trying to hold onto is the bourgeois opposition bloc, in which the CHP is the playmaker.Their program is the neoliberal bourgeois program of normalization.They are in the mood of “We will win the elections, stay calm and wait for the elections”.]]If they win, what they promised to the workers is nothing different than “the first years of  AKP government”.So what will the socialists, who represent the most general interests of the working people, do? Should they wait for the elections passively, as the bourgeois opposition parties do; and rush to grab a seat or two in the parliament? Unfortunately, the socialists have limited their activities mainly to social media “activism” for a long time.]]Activities that require determination and energy, such as organizing the workers and raising revolutionary cadres among the youth, are not the case for the socialist left now.In these circumstances, unfortunately, elections are really watched for and life is spent with social media activism.Those who can do it make a parliamentary conjecture.
