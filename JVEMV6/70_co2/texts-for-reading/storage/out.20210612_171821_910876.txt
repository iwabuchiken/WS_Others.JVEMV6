In physics, a gauge theory is a type of field theory in which ]] the Lagrangian does not change (is invariant) under local transformations from certain Lie groups.]]The term gauge refers ]] to any specific mathematical formalism to regulate redundant degrees of freedom in the Lagrangian.]]The transformations between possible gauges, called gauge transformations, ]] form a Lie group—referred to as the symmetry group or the gauge group of the theory.]]Associated with any Lie group is the Lie algebra of group generators.]]For each group generator there necessarily arises a corresponding field (usually a vector field) called the gauge field.Gauge fields are included in the Lagrangian to ensure its invariance under the local group transformations (called gauge invariance).When such a theory is quantized, the quanta of the gauge fields are called gauge bosons.If the symmetry group is non-commutative, then the gauge theory is referred to as non-abelian gauge theory, the usual example being the Yang–Mills theory.
