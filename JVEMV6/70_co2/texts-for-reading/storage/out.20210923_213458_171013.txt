Brazil's indigenous people struggle against an entrenched oligarchy determined to drive them from their lands and a right wing president who is supported by the U.S.  
Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro has given new license to the killing  of Indigenous people in Brazil.Before he came to power in 2019, it wasn’t clear what he wanted to build, but he knew exactly who and what he wanted to destroy: the Indigenous people and the Amazon rainforest, respectively.
“Bolsonaro attacked a woman first, the land, our mother,” the Indigenous leader Célia Xakriabá told me.“We have no choice but to fight back.” 
Since becoming president, the former Army captain, who served under the country’s last military dictator, has led an unprecedented war against the environment and the people protecting it.A slew of anti-Indigenous legislation , escalated  violence against and assassinations of Indigenous land defenders, and the COVID-19 pandemic  have threatened the existence of Brazil’s original people, the Amazon rainforest, and the future of the planet.
