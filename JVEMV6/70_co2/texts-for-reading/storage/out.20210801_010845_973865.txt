The origins of the CCP 
At the end of the First World War, “(…) there was a great industrial development, uneven and dependent, serving foreign interests more than national ones.But this stimulated the presence of the labor movement on the national scene and in the main cities”.3 Undoubtedly, what has been described, together with the impact of the Bolshevik Revolution of 1917, motivated the birth of the CCP in 1921. The support of Lenin and the Comintern were decisive in the emergence of this revolutionary party that was constituted on the basis of a dozen university students and professors, but saw an accelerated growth in the last years of the 1920s.The insertion of its best cadres in the labor movement promoting the formation of unions and intervening in the confrontations of the workers and the mass movement against the ruling party bore fruit.By 1927 it had become a reference for large layers and reached a membership of over 55,000 militants.This position was dilapidated by the international politics of the Comitern, already under the leadership of Stalin, imposing a policy of class conciliation with the Kuomintang on the Chinese party.This orientation, which reflected the theory of the Revolution by Stages, according to which the task of the CP was limited to supporting the national bourgeoisie to get rid of the clutches of imperialism and then develop capitalism in China, led to the defeat of the revolutions of ’25 and ’27 in China.A fact highlighted by a thesis outlined by Trotsky: “the ruling classes of the colonial and semi-colonial peoples are incapable of leading the struggle against imperialism as long as this struggle takes the form of a mass revolutionary movement”.4
