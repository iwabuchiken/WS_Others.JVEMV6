Introduction.Mesh generation and mesh adaptation are essential processes for numericalmethods like finite element and finite volume simulations.]]The quality of themesh will tremendously affect the accuracy and efficiency of the methods.Research shows that the actual meaning of the mesh quality depends on thereal problem (isotropic or anisotropic features) ]] and the objectives (minimizingthe interpolation error or improving the conditioning number).]] The use of a metric tensor field for mesh quality and mesh size specificationis now a widely used tool for mesh generation and mesh adaptation.]]We adoptthe concept of an M-uniform mesh[3], which considers any adaptive meshas a uniform one in some metric depending on the quantity of interest.]]Inother words, an M-uniformmesh is an ideal mesh for a given metric whichmay be a combination of several criteria, like element quality, element size,and element orientation, etc.]]With this concept, the meshing problem can beformalized as]] :How to generate the M-uniformmesh for a given metric.It is avery challenging problem in theory.]]
