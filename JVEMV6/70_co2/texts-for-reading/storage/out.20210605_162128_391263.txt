Current StatusThe current stage of the technology is still very experimental.The majority of tests have beenperformed on a laboratory scale with a purpose of either kinetic analysis or proof-of-concept to examineproduct distribution for different material and condition combinations [A1, A2, A3].An advantage ofelectrochemical CO2 reduction is that unlike many other hydrocarbon processes it can easily beperformed at ambient conditions.However, being at the experimental level there is still considerablework to be done to bring the process up to a commercial level.Typical current densities have been onthe order of milliamps per square centimeter (mA/cm2) of electrode and catalyst surface, whereasindustrial water electrolyzers operate at up to 2 A/cm2[A12].This current state can be improved as ithas been for water electrolysis by improved cell design and electrode configuration.However, this stillhas yet to be demonstrated in literature.For this analysis it has been assumed that the reduction cellcan operate at the same level as typical water electrolyzers.
