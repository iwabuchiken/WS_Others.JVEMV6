7.2.4	 Processing 7.2.4.1 Mining and mine reclamation Mining serpentine would not differ substantially from conventional mining of other minerals with similar properties, for example copper ores.Serpentine and olivine are both mined already, although rarely on the scale envisioned here (Goff and Lackner, 1998;Goff et al., 2000).Like in othermining operations, disposal of tailings and mine reclamation are important issues to consider.Tailing disposal depends on the material characteristics – particle size and cohesion, moisture content and chemical stability against natural leaching processes – and these depend in turn on the specific process.It is likely that carbonation plants will be located near the metal oxide bearing material, either the factory producing the residues to be treated or the silicate mine, to avoid transport of solid materials (see Figure 7.2).Economies of scale applying to today’s mining technology suggest a minimum mining operation of 50,000 to 100,000 tonnes day–1 (Hartman, 1992), which translates into a minimum mineable volume of about 0.3 km3 for a mine with a 30 year life.This is a rather small size for ophiolite ore bodies, which are often kilometres wide and hundreds of meters thick (Goff and Lackner, 1998; Goff et al., 2000; Newall et al., 2000).Since coal, in contrast to ophiolite bodies, occurs in thin seams and is buried under substantial overburden, it has been argued that a typical above ground coal mine must move more material (Lackner et al., 1995) and disturb a far larger area (Ziock and Lackner, 2000) for the same amount of carbon atoms treated than the equivalent ophiolite mine, assuming maximum conversion of the mineral to carbonate (one carbon atom yields one CO2  molecule upon combustion, which has to be fixed in one molecule of carbonate).
