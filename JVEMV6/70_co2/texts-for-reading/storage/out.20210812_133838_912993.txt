About 260 Palestinians were killed in the 11-day Israeli offensive.Also on Wednesday, Israeli forces demolished Palestinian-owned structures to the east of Yatta City, south of the occupied West Bank city of al-Khalil (Hebron).According to WAFA, Israeli bulldozers destroyed a rainwater harvesting well in the area of Khallet al-Dabe', east of Yatta, under the pretext that it is built in the area C, which accounts for more than 60 percent of the occupied West Bank, and forms a significant part of a future Palestine state under the so-called two-state solution.Israeli forces also demolished an agricultural facility in the area of al-Fakhit as well as three residential structures.Press TV’s website can also be accessed at the following alternate addresses:
