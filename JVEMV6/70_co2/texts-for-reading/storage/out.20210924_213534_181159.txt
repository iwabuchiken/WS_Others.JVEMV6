The plight of Palestinian women in Israeli prisons 
Owing to significant political pressure, Palestinian prisoner Anhar al-Deek was able to give birth outside of prison walls this month.

She was granted a conditional release on 40,000-shekel (or $12,500) bail.

While she is no longer behind bars in Damon prison, court proceedings continue.




Activists mobilized around al-Deek, emphasizing the inhumanity of shackling a woman to her bed as she gives birth.

Anhar and Israa’s cases are not the exception but rather part of a systematic pattern of discrimination Israel enforces over Palestinian women in jail.]]




According to Addameer, 41 Palestinian women are in prison, including one in administrative detention, 26 serving sentences and 14 awaiting or under trial.

Twelve of these women are mothers.




“Israel’s systematic policy of arbitrary arrests and administrative detention does include thousands of Palestinian women,” Ansari said.

“So Israel does not discriminate with its arbitrary policies between Palestinian women or men or children or the elderly.” 
Ansari emphasized, however, women face further discrimination inside Israeli jails, specifically when it comes to women’s concerns and needs.

“We have documentation of a female student who was subjected to ill treatment and torture while she was on her period,” Ansari said, noting the Israeli authorities didn’t provide the student, Mays Abu Ghosh, with feminine hygiene products.




While all prisons are equipped with a medical clinic, this healthcare does not include gynecological services.

Arabic-speaking, female medical specialists are also rare, as is culturally and religiously sensitive treatment.

“It’s not only the arbitrary policies that are implemented on all Palestinians but also the gendered ones,” Ansari said.
