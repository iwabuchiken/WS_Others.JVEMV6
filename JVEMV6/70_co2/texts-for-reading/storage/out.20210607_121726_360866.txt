This signals the breakdown of the general theory of relativity and the need for a theory that goes beyond general relativity into the quantum.At distances very close to the center of the black hole (closer than the Planck length), quantum fluctuations of spacetime are expected to play an important role.[2] To describe these quantum effects a theory of quantum gravity is needed.Such a theory should allow the description to be extended closer to the center and might even allow an understanding of physics at the center of a black hole.On more formal grounds, one can argue that a classical system cannot consistently be coupled to a quantum one.[3][4]:11â€“12 
The field of quantum gravity is actively developing, and theorists are exploring a variety of approaches to the problem of quantum gravity, the most popular being M-theory and loop quantum gravity.[5] All of these approaches aim to describe the quantum behavior of the gravitational field.This does not necessarily include unifying all fundamental interactions into a single mathematical framework.However, many approaches to quantum gravity, such as string theory, try to develop a framework that describes all fundamental forces.Such theories are often referred to as a theory of everything.Others, such as loop quantum gravity, make no such attempt; instead, they make an effort to quantize the gravitational field while it is kept separate from the other forces.
