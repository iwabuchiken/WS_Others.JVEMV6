Greenhouse Gas Emission Stabilization Strategy The transportation sector is the second largest source of human induced CO2 emissions in the U.S., which is due to the burning of petroleum derived fossil fuels amounting to approximately 1,800 teragrams CO2 Eq.[A10].While human induced CO2 emissions (approx.26.4 Gt) are not a significant amount of CO2 in relation to the natural carbon cycle of Earth (approx.440 Gt), the fact that these emissions have no new carbon sink causes the build-up of GHG emissions in the atmosphere [A11].In result, slightly more CO2 is being built up in the atmosphere each year which potentially has detrimental consequences to the global climate system.EIA conclusions estimate that carbon needs to be taxed at about $80/ton CO2 to have a realistic chance at achieving 50% reductions in emissions by 2050. Since current market forces for CO2 sequestration are technically and economically unfeasible, another CO2 stabilization strategy may be necessary.It is important to appreciate that the sequestration of CO2 from coal power plants is not the only possible route toward the required CO2 reductions goals, as eliminating the carbon contributions from the petroleum sector would achieve even a greater reduction in CO2 emissions, being over 60%.The potentially viable method of CO2 electrolysis to hydrocarbons could utilize waste CO2 from coal power plants to produce liquid transport fuels to off-set petroleum consumption, thus mitigating CO2 emissions from the transportation sector.
