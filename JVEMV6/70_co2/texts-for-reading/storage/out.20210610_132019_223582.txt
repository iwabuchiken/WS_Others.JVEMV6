In mathematics, a diffeomorphism is ]] an isomorphism in the category of smooth manifolds.]]It is an invertible function]]  that maps one differentiable manifold to another,]] such that both the function and its inverse are smooth.]]These are the defining symmetry transformations of General Relativity since the theory is formulated only in terms of a differentiable manifold.]]
