Saving Lifta The Save Lifta Coalition orchestrated the campaign to the mayor and has been organizing since 2010 against Plan 6036. The organization spent five years working with scholars, activists, conservation specialists and higher education professionals to develop an alternative to 6036.]]Their proposal aims to “expand the area of the national park and turn the village into a natural urban space for the adjacent neighborhoods,” while preserving Lifta’s cultural landscape.The World Monuments Fund added Lifta to its list of endangered sites in 2018 and UNESCO added the village to its tentative list of world heritage sites.  ‘Not something we can discuss now’ When asked about the plan’s responsibility regarding the right of return for Palestinians, Golan-Agnon said, “our plan is a plan to save Lifta as it is for the future generations to decide upon its fate.” She explained: Many of us [in the coalition] do think there should be a right of return for Palestinians but we know it’s not something we can discuss now.]]So we say, it’s beautiful, keep it open, and then one day there can be a decision about what happens and who’s coming.Dana Amawi’s grandmother grew up in Lifta and was expelled from the village in 1948. Now the family lives in Amman, Jordan.The 20-year-old said she was shaken to her core upon hearing the news of the sale.“Lifta symbolized a tiny, very small bit of hope that maybe we will be able to return to it,” Amawi told MintPress.“And now to think that other people might live in the house that I have the right to be in, it’s very sad.”
