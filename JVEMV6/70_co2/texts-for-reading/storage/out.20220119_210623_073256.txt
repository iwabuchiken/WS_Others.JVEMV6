It’s quite clear in Don’t Look Up that McKay and company are primarily concerned with raising awareness of the climate crisis through a liberal lens.The protagonists, two scientists, go on a crusade to convince the establishment to solve a crisis that will literally take down the entire planet.While climate change certainly mirrors this kind of crisis, the way that we go about addressing it is always a reflection of politics.The film emphasizes a struggle between a noble scientific community and an ever-resistant, short-sighted elite.People’s movements receive very little attention in the and when one emerges it is reduced to a hashtag campaign that does little more than spread awareness of the crisis at hand.
This sends a cynical message to viewers that while powerful elites are the root of all problems, they are also the only force capable of stopping the comet (climate) crisis or any other malady of capitalism.The distracted and alienated masses may rise up in rebellion and pressure politicians to behave differently but in the end it just isn’t enough to alter the trajectory of the system.In the U.S.context, there certainly is truth to this assumption.The U.S.left has been violently suppressed by the state, the consolidation of state power around endless austerity and war has produced unprecedented levels of despair and alienation, and movements such as Black Lives Matter, the environmental movement, Occupy Wall Street, among others have been unable to forestall capitalism’s Race to the Bottom.
