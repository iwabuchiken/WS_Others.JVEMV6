“I remember one day my mother was preparing the fire to heat our room, and then [the Zionist miltiias] began to shoot.My brothers began to cry, ‘Mama, mama! They’re shooting us!’ My mom took us inside the room in the corner and under a table to protect us,” Odeh said, recalling two stories of Lifta — the town’s beauty and charm and then its tragic fall.]]“There is the beautiful life and then began the miserable life because of the occupation.” Toward the end of February 1948, Odeh’s father put him, his siblings and his mother into a truck heading to Ramallah to escape the violence in Lifta.Odeh’s father stayed behind to defend the village from the Zionist gangs.“We were only wearing the clothing we had on because we are coming back tomorrow.We are coming back.Now we just want to be far from the shooting.” Odeh took a deep sigh and said, “In one hour, we became refugees.” Today, 55 buildings out of approximately 450 remain in Lifta, including a club, mosque, cemetery and school, which now operates as a school for Israeli Jews.]]Liftawi refugees are estimated at around 30,000 and live in Jerusalem, the Occupied West Bank and the Diaspora.Most of the homes are empty, but a few are occupied by Israeli settlers.According to Zochrot, ]] the Israeli nonprofit seeking to raise awareness of the Nakba, the “settlements of Mey Niftoach and Giv’at Sha’ul were built on village lands and now have become parts of the suburbs of Jerusalem.”
