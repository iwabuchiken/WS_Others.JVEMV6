In quantum mechanics, ]] the Hamiltonian of a system is an operator corresponding to the total energy of that system, ]] including both kinetic energy and potential energy.]]Its spectrum, the system's energy spectrum ]] or its set of energy eigenvalues, ]] is the set of possible outcomes ]] obtainable from a measurement of the system's total energy.]]Due to its close relation to the energy spectrum and time-evolution of a system, it is of fundamental importance in most formulations of quantum theory.The Hamiltonian is named after ]] William Rowan Hamilton, who developed a revolutionary reformulation of Newtonian mechanics, ]] known as Hamiltonian mechanics, which was historically important to the development of quantum physics.]]Similar to vector notation, ]] it is typically denoted by H ^ {\displaystyle {\hat {H}}} {\hat {H}}, where the hat indicates that it is an operator.It can also be written as H {\displaystyle H} H or H Ë‡ {\displaystyle {\check {H}}} {\check {H}}.]]
