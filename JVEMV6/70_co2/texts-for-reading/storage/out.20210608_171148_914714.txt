In theoretical physics, general covariance is ]] the invariance of the form of physical laws]] under arbitrary differentiable coordinate transformations.]]The essential idea is that coordinates are only artifices ]] used in describing nature, ]] and hence should play no role in the formulation of fundamental physical laws.]]A more significant requirement is the principle of general relativity ]] that states that the laws of physics take the same form in all reference systems.]]This is a generalization of the principle of special relativity which states ]] that the laws of physics take the same form in all inertial frames.]]In mathematics, a diffeomorphism is an isomorphism in the category of smooth manifolds.]]It is an invertible function that maps one differentiable manifold to another, such that both the function and its inverse are smooth.These are the defining symmetry transformations of General Relativity since the theory is formulated only in terms of a differentiable manifold.
