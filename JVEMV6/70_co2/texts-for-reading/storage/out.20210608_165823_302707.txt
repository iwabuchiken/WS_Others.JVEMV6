The most well-developed theory that has been advanced as a direct result of loop quantum gravity is called loop quantum cosmology (LQC).]]LQC advances the study of the early universe, incorporating the concept of the Big Bang into the broader theory of the Big Bounce, ]] which envisions the Big Bang as the beginning of a period of expansion that follows a period of contraction, which one could talk of as the Big Crunch.]]
