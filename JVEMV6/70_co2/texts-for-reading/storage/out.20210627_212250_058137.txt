Second, these vaccines, Pfizer in particular, are the cornerstone of the US-led global vaccination effort that has now pledged 1 billion doses to poor countries.]]If it were the case that these vaccines were pulled, countries might lose faith in them, pull them and then the US would lose some of the soft power it’s looking for through these donations.]]The US wants to use these vaccines to expand its global influence and prove that “democracy” (neoliberal capitalism) is the best socioeconomic system to spur innovation and provide basic necessities for people, which is clearly doomed to fail since the severity of the Covid-19 pandemic was driven by this system in the first place.]]Put simply, the US wants to pull a “come-from-behind” victory on the pandemic and prove that its brand of for-profit medicine can address a global health emergency even though putting profits ahead of people is exactly why millions of people, including over 600,000 Americans, died from Covid-19. At the same time, Moderna and Pfizer are more than happy to lap up profits paid for mainly by Johnny Taxpayer.To be perfectly clear, I am not advocating against taking mRNA vaccines.]]These vaccines are shown to be highly effective against transmission, hospitalization and death, so of course you should take them.Any potential risks are far outweighed by potential complications from actually catching Covid-19, especially as more virulent variants, like the Delta or Gamma variants, become predominant in many parts of the world.
