Central Bank of Iran (CBI) figures show 

		that money supply in the country rose 
		
		by 38.7% in the 12 months to late December last year 
		
		to reach the equivalent of $165.18 billion.




CBI figures published on Sunday on the bank’s website showed 

		that Iran’s M3 money supply had reached 44,269.9 trillion rials, 
		
		up 13.7% against figures reported in late September 
		
		but down 0.6% against November.




The figures indicated 
		
		that M1 money supply, 
		which includes cash in circulation and checkable deposits in banks, 
		
		rose 42.3% in the year to December 21 
		to 8,779.00 trillion rilas ($32.75 billion) 
		
		while near money or M2 money supply, 
		
		which covers savings and time deposits, increased 41.2% year on year in December 
		to 35,490.9 trillion rials ($132.43 billion).




The bank said 
		
		that nearly a tenth of the 27.4% growth in money supply in the three quarters to late December last year 
		
		had been due to an acquisition that took place in Iran’s largest lender Bank Sepah.




The figures showed 

		that Iran’s monetary base, 
		
		which covers the cash in circulation and deposits held by the CBI, 
		
		rose 37.6% year on year in late December 
		to 5,608.60 trillion rials (nearly $20.92 billion).




Government debt to the CBI 

		declined 75.1% in the three quarters to December 21 
		
		to minus 393.69 trillion rials (minus $1.47 billion), said the bank.

  
The data showed 

		that debts owed by private and state-run banks to the CBI 
		
		rose by 31.2% over the same period to 1,537.4 trillion rials ($5.73 billion).




They showed 
		that total foreign assets held by the CBI and other Iranian banks and institutions 
		
		rose 32% year on year in late December to reach 6,981.3 trillion rials ($26.05 billion).
