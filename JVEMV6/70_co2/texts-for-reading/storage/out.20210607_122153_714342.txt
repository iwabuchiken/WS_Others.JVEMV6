Much of the difficulty in meshing these theories at all energy scales comes from the different assumptions that these theories make on how the universe works.General relativity models gravity as curvature of spacetime: in the slogan of John Archibald Wheeler, "Spacetime tells matter how to move; matter tells spacetime how to curve."[9] On the other hand, quantum field theory is typically formulated in the flat spacetime used in special relativity.No theory has yet proven successful in describing the general situation where the dynamics of matter, modeled with quantum mechanics, affect the curvature of spacetime.If one attempts to treat gravity as simply another quantum field, the resulting theory is not renormalizable.[10] Even in the simpler case where the curvature of spacetime is fixed a priori, developing quantum field theory becomes more mathematically challenging, and many ideas physicists use in quantum field theory on flat spacetime are no longer applicable.[11] 
It is widely hoped that a theory of quantum gravity would allow us to understand problems of very high energy and very small dimensions of space, such as the behavior of black holes, and the origin of the universe.[1]
