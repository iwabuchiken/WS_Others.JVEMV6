In dynamical system theory, a phase space is ]] a space in which all possible states of a system ]] are represented, with each possible state corresponding to one unique point in the phase space.]]For mechanical systems, the phase space usually consists of all possible values of position and momentum variables.]]The concept of phase space was developed in the late 19th century by Ludwig Boltzmann, Henri Poincar√©, and Josiah Willard Gibbs.[1] ]]
