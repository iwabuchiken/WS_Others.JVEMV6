In many ways, the change we are witnessing now has been a long time coming.Over the past decade, I have increasingly seen criticism of the way this conflict is understood and covered.U.S.newspaper headlines have been admonished  for obscuring violence committed by Israeli soldiers through use of the passive voice.Pop stars like Lorde have publicly refused to perform in Tel Aviv  as part of a boycott campaign against the occupation.During the 2019 Democratic presidential primary campaign, many of the candidates, including Bernie Sanders and Kamala Harris, publicly declined invitations  to speak at the pro-Israel lobbying group AIPAC’s annual conference.This slow, if steady, trickle of awareness, has turned into a flood during this wave of violence.
What does any of this have to do with Black Lives Matter? Black-Palestinian solidarity stretches back decades , and from the first days of Black Lives Matter , organizers have explicitly linked these two movements.Philosopher and activist Angela Davis  has long acknowledged  the deep links between the U.S.prison-industrial complex, racial violence, and Palestinian political incarceration.During the protests in Ferguson, Missouri, after the police killing of Michael Brown in 2014,  protesters held  signs expressing solidarity with Palestinians and Palestinians took to social media to share instructions for how to treat tear gas.
