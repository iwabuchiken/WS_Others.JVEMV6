This community center in the southern part of New Delhi is a virtual school for hundreds and sometimes thousands of children who consider it hard to cope with the online study pattern following the COVID-19 pandemic which led to the closure of schools across the Indian subcontinent leading to devastating impact on the future generation.
Many parents say it has impacted both the learning patterns and social contact of the children.Meena Mandal is very anxious about her daughter who is yet to see the school due to delayed admission following the COVID outbreak.
Many parents and children we spoke with at this community center run by the Kailash Satyarthi children’s foundation, “a nonprofit organization”, had a similar opinion that of Meena.Experts say the administration should take drastic steps to avoid a loss of generation.
Many children we spoke with are curious to see classrooms again.Their parents are anxious saying the damage school shutdowns have caused is enormous.
The closure of schools have also sparked psychological and physical impact on millions of children across the country especially those in rural parts where the internet is dismal and people have limited access to the internet, electricity and smartphones.Experts say the consequences of school closures would only be known once data about the enrollment and dropout is officially released.
Apparently, the COVID-associated closure of schools has left a devastating impact on the overall development of children and the educational structures.And now, the spread of the Omicron variant has further prolonged this closure.But after facing a backlash from concerned parents, the Indian administration is considering a gradual re-opening of schools, starting next month.
