Tetrahedral mesh generation has been studied extensively for decades.There are established methods for mesh generation and mesh adaptation, see,e.g., [2].]]Robust software implementations exist and some of them are freelyavailable.]]Most of the codes provide the option to take a user-defined meshsizing function or a metric tensor field as input and generate an adaptedtetrahedral meshes with respect to it.]]A practical question naturally arises:How close are meshes computed by some common mesh generators to beingM-uniform?So far, only few works addressed this question in theory [5,6].]]Numerical experiments suggest that, at least in two dimensions, meshes thatare close to beM-uniform can be generated in practice [3, 5, 6]]
