Brazil's indigenous people struggle against an entrenched oligarchy determined to drive them from their lands and a right wing president who is supported by the U.S.

  
Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro has given new license to the killing  of Indigenous people in Brazil.

Before he came to power in 2019, it wasn’t clear what he wanted to build, but he knew exactly who and what he wanted to destroy: the Indigenous people and the Amazon rainforest, respectively.]]




“Bolsonaro attacked a woman first, the land, our mother,” the Indigenous leader Célia Xakriabá told me.

“We have no choice but to fight back.” 
Since becoming president, the former Army captain, who served under the country’s last military dictator, has led an unprecedented war against the environment and the people protecting it.

A slew of anti-Indigenous legislation , escalated  violence against and assassinations of Indigenous land defenders, and the COVID-19 pandemic  have threatened the existence of Brazil’s original people, the Amazon rainforest, and the future of the planet.




Under Bolsonaro’s oversight, about 7,700 square miles (20,000 square kilometers ) of the Amazon has been deforested, mostly by fires  caused by the cattle and logging industries.

The destruction of the Amazon rainforest is pushing the biome toward an irreversible tipping point where it won’t be able to renew itself and making the Amazon uninhabitable for Indigenous people.]]




Meanwhile, in 2021, scientists found  that for the first time the Amazon has been emitting more CO2 than it has been absorbing.

The Amazon—often touted as the “lungs of the planet ” for the oxygen it creates—seems to be dying faster than it is growing.




But Indigenous people, who call this forest their home, refuse to disappear.
