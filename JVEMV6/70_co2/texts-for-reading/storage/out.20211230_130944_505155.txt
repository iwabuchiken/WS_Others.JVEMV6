Undoubtedly, Raeisi’s election by the Iranian people was rooted in the public disinterest and resentment that had been caused by the West and the US’s constant non-commitment.The public had also grown weary of the support that some would lend the mindset that was in favor of cooperation with the West in favor of resolution of the Islamic Republic’s problems.]]Facing Iran’s decisive reactions in the face of its excessive demands, the United States has been forced to row back from its illogical positions, and is trying to render the Iranian negotiators inactive through psychological pressure by creating the impression that there exists a time limit for reaching an agreement.The question that the Western side, especially the Americans, have failed to answer so far here is why the time element always has to work against Iran! ]]Why the time element is so important right now, while it was not during the years that went by following Trump’s departure from the deal and his imposition of toughest sanctions on Iran or even during the five months that passed following the new administration’s assumption of power, during which the administration failed to work towards removal of the sanctions, and instead sought to deploy Trump’s sanctions towards applying more pressure on Iran? Beyond any doubt, Iran’s principled positions would not be affected by the US and Europe’s political and psychological games this time either, and the Iranian negotiators would not compromise the Iranian nation’s rights in favor of bogus time limits.]]If the Western sides are so pressed for time, the best and fastest way of relieving this pressure is for them to remove all the sanctions and return to their commitments under the deal.This article was originally published in Farsi by Nour News website, which is affiliated with Iran’s Supreme National Security Council (SNSC).Press TV’s website can also be accessed at the following alternate addresses:
