In 1986, Abhay Ashtekar reformulated Einstein's general relativity in a language ]] closer to that of the rest of fundamental physics.[citation needed] Shortly after, ]] Ted Jacobson and Lee Smolin realized ]] that the formal equation of quantum gravity, called the Wheelerâ€“DeWitt equation, ]] admitted solutions labelled by loops when rewritten in the new Ashtekar variables.]]Carlo Rovelli and Smolin defined a nonperturbative and background-independent quantum theory of gravity in terms of these loop solutions.]]Jorge Pullin and Jerzy Lewandowski ]] understood that the intersections of the loops are essential for the consistency of the theory, ]] and the theory should be formulated in terms of intersecting loops, or graphs.]]In 1994, Rovelli and Smolin ]] showed that the quantum operators of the theory associated to area and volume ]] have a discrete spectrum.]]That is, geometry is quantized.]]This result defines an explicit basis of states of quantum geometry, ]] which turned out to be labelled by Roger Penrose's spin networks, which are graphs labelled by spins.]]
