B’tselem declared Israel an apartheid state in January 2021. The international rights group Human Rights Watch (HRW) followed suit in April, also denouncing the Israeli apartheid state.That was only a few weeks before Project Nimbus was declared.It was as if Google and Amazon were purposely declaring their support of apartheid.The fact that the project was signed during the Israeli war on Gaza speaks volumes about the two tech giants’ complete disregard of international law, human rights and the very freedom of the Palestinian people.It gets worse.On March 15, hundreds of Google workers signed a petition protesting the firing of one of their colleagues, Ariel Koren, who was active in generating the October letter in protest of Project Nimbus.Koren was the product marketing manager at Google for Education, and has worked for the company for six years.However, she was the kind of employee who was not welcomed by the likes of Google, as the company is now directly involved with various military and security projects.“For me, as a Jewish employee of Google, I feel a deep sense of intense moral responsibility,” she said in a statement last October.“When you work in a company, you have the right to be accountable and responsible for the way that your labor is actually being used,” she added.Google quickly retaliated to that seemingly outrageous statement.The following month, Koren’s manager “presented her with an ultimatum: move to Brazil or lose her position.” Eventually, she was driven out of the company.Koren was not the first Google – or Amazon – employee to be fired for standing up for a good cause, nor would, sadly, be the last.In this age of militarism, surveillance, unwarranted facial recognition and censorship, speaking one’s mind and daring to fight for human rights and other basic freedoms is no longer an option.]]
