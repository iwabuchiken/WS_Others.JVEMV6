Read Racism, Liberation, and US Political Prisoners, an analysis of political imprisonment in the United States ]]
This is a list of individuals who are currently incarcerated in the United States, are targets because of their actions threatening U.S.

imperial power, and who were imprisoned for their political activity.]]

AfGJ considers them both political prisoners and “Prisoners of Empire.” We define Political Prisoners as people who are jailed based on charges related to resistance to oppression and repression.]]

Whether the circumstances of the alleged crimes are true or false, we strenuously reject the individualized and out-of-context treatment of these cases as simply “common crimes.” Rather, they are, each and every one, related to some ongoing struggle against repression and Empire.]]

Our listing of these prisoners does not constitute endorsement of the tactics or goals of every individual.]]

In many cases those arrested have been clearly set up, falsely accused, railroaded, and/or denied adequate defense and basic human rights.

In every instance, the cases are  political in nature, and require a political solution.

We also recognize that people have a right to resist oppression, and the failure to do so is itself a crime against the people.]]




Please see the notes at the bottom of the page regarding Guantanamo Bay, immigrant detention, and mass incarceration.

We want to acknowledge Stan Smith and the Chicago Committee to Free the Five (773-376-7521, uscubachi@yahoo.com) for initiating this project and compiling the original list in 2013.  
We need your help.

This list is an ongoing draft.

If you see any mistakes, persons who should be listed who are not included, have updates on the status of political prisoners or have any other questions or comments, please send them to James@AFGJ.org .
