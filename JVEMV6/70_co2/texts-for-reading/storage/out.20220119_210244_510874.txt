The film obviously did something right to receive a flurry of negative reviews from the capitalist press.Don’t Look Up embarrasses elites and convincingly exposes their opportunism through satire.The relationship between U.S.President Janie Orlean and mega campaign donor/tech capitalist Peter Ishawell offers a clear presentation of the relationship between corporate power and politics in the United States.Ishawell asserts his influence on numerous occasions to ensure that President Orleans’ policies benefit his bottom line.Everything is subordinate to Ishawell’s lust for profit, from predictions about death to the illustrious natural resources that reside on a comet that threatens to eliminate life itself.The normalcy with which Pentagon General Stuart Themes charges the group of scientists for free snacks is one of several humorous examples where Don’t Look Up demonstrates the detestable behavior of the self-serving ruling class.
Overall, there were aspects of the film that I enjoyed and others that I didn’t.Dr.Mindy’s descent into celebrity was an entertaining example of how no amount of access to the capitalist class can change a system under its firm control.President Orleans’ expression of a hybrid Trump/Clinton political identity was an equally entertaining window into the corruption-ridden social character of the U.S.political system.Unfortunately, the film fell into the many perils of Western liberalism.Director Adam McKay clarified the liberal politics of the film when he pronounced that “awareness, will, and action” (and labs, apparently) are what’s needed to solve the climate crisis.
