A basic schematic of the likely system is shown in the figure below.The feed streams would consist of CO2, water, and electricity.For this analysis the CO2 would likely be captured at a coal fired power plant operating under sequestration and purchased as feed.While this could provide a cheap source of reactant, the stream would probably contain trace amounts of NOx and SOx.The NOx could lead to acidic conditions in the cell, changing the reaction conditions and possibly increasing the material corrosion of the cell.Presence of SOx would be more detrimental to operation, as it is a well-known catalyst poison.For these reasons the CO2 feed would likely have to be filtered and the contaminants removed.This would further increase the capital and energy costs of the system, though it is not included in this analysis.The water feed could be standard industrial water.This would need to be filtered, but since it is standard procedure for electrolysis cells it should not increase the system costs.Since most of the systems require an aqueous electrolyte a management system would need to be in place to control the pH and conductivity of the solution.This provides an issue, as this is common in alkaline electrolysis but not in PEM electrolysis.For a PEM cell the advantage is that the more expensive membrane material usually reduces the need for an electrolyte solution, removing the need for the additional processing equipment found in alkaline cells.Since our cell would likely require both this would further increase the capital and operating costs of the system.
