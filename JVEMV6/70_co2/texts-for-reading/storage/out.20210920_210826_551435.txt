In a statement, the campaign said Israa needs “a surgery to separate her burnt fingers, another to transplant skin that would cover exposed bones, and another to separate ears, which burnt and got stuck.” Additionally, Israa “cannot raise her arms because her underarm skin is stuck.She also needs surgeries to fix the skin around her right eye, nose, and lips.” Israa can’t breathe through her nose because of the burns on her face so she only breathes through her mouth.According to Israa’s sister, Mona Jaabis, doctors estimate she needs between six to eight surgeries.]]“The doctors said, ‘We need to see her to give an accurate number [of surgeries],’” Mona told MintPress News.“We’ve tried to send some specialist doctors inside the jail to meet Israa but our requests always get denied.”In a video posted to social media, Israa’s 12-year-old son, Motasem Jaabis, appealed to the international community for help.]]Holding a photo of Israa, Motasem said, “I’ve been deprived of my mom.I’ve been deprived of her for six years now.Whenever I return home, I don’t see my mother like any other child.”“I’m calling upon the world to treat my mom,” he added.The online campaign reached the streets of Gaza, where protesters stood in solidarity with Israa outside the Gaza City office of the International Committee of the Red Cross.Palestinian Health Minister Mai al-Kaila met with Mona on Sunday and assured her that the government is rallying the international community and human rights and health organizations to get Israa treated and released from prison.
