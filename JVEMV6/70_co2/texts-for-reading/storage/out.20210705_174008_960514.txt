Panda3D is a 3D engine: a library of subroutines for 3D rendering and game development.]]The library is C++ with a set of Python bindings.Game development with Panda3D usually consists of writing a Python or C++ program that controls the Panda3D library.]]Panda3D was created for commercial game development and is still used for developing commercial games.Because of this, the engine needs to emphasize four areas: power, speed, completeness, and error tolerance.]]Everyone knows what power and speed are.But completeness and error tolerance deserve some extra commentary.]]Completeness means that Panda3D contains many unexciting but essential tools: scene graph browsing, performance monitoring, animation optimizers, and so forth.]]Error tolerance is about the fact that all game developers create bugs.]]When you do, you want your engine to give you a clear error message and help you find the mistake.]]Too many engines will just crash if you pass the wrong value to a function.]]Panda3D almost never crashes, and much code is dedicated to the problem of tracking and isolating errors.]]Finally, to come back to power and speed: to gauge Panda3D’s capabilities you can take a look at the Sample Programs.]]These are short programs that demonstrate a sampling of Panda3D’s capabilities.]]The screenshots have frame-rates in the upper-right corner, taken on a Radeon X700. Note that some samples are old and use placeholder art and so are not great examples of Panda3D’s visual capabilities.]]Panda3D was developed by Disney for their massively multiplayer online game, Toontown Online.It was released as free software in 2002. Carnegie Mellon University’s Entertainment Technology Center, which currently hosts the website and other Panda3D services, was actively involved in the development of Panda3D into an open source project.]]It is now developed jointly by Disney and contributors from around the world.You can read more about Panda3D’s Features.
