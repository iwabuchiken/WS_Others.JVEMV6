A fundamental lesson of general relativity ]] is that there is no fixed spacetime background, as found in Newtonian mechanics and special relativity; the spacetime geometry is dynamic.]]While simple to grasp in principle, this is a complex idea to understand about general relativity, and its consequences are profound and not fully explored, even at the classical level.]]To a certain extent, general relativity can be seen to be ]] a relational theory,]] [25] in which the only physically relevant information is the relationship between different events in space-time.]]On the other hand, quantum mechanics has ]] depended since its inception on a fixed background (non-dynamic) structure.]]In the case of quantum mechanics, it is time that is given and not dynamic, just as in Newtonian classical mechanics.]]In relativistic quantum field theory, just as in classical field theory, Minkowski spacetime is the fixed background of the theory.]]
