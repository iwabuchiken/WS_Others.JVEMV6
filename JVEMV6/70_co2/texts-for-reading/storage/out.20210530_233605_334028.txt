We must go bomb some country to prevent genocide, they tell us, except in the one case of where there really was a huge slaughter, which was in Rwanda.There the United States chose to stay out, and even had UN peacekeepers withdrawn, so that their guy—Paul Kagame—could seize power. 
But it's very easy to go in when there isn't any genocide and say you went in to prevent this genocide, which was never going to happen, as in Kosovo and in Libya.And these are two cases of this so-called humanitarian intervention that simply destroyed countries that the United States wanted to destroy and give NATO its new mission. 
In order to keep control of Western Europe after the Soviet Union collapsed, the United States had to preserve NATO, which is the way the United States controls Europe.So, in order to preserve NATO, they found a new mission, which is humanitarian warfare.The Kosovo war was an example of that. It transformed NATO from a defensive force into an offensive force with a humanitarian mission.That was the purpose of the Kosovo war.And the German Green Party’s foreign minister, Joschka Fisher, was the prophet of all that.
