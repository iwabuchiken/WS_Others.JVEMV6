As Afghans are struggling with rising hunger combined with a harsh winter, the Iranian embassy in Kabul in cooperation with Imam Khomeini Relief Foundation distributes rounds of food aid to vulnerable people across Afghanistan.Here in Kabul, hundreds of needy people have gathered to benefit from the Iranian aid.
Unemployment, cash shortage and a raise in prices have switched many Afghan families to poverty and hunger.Nowadays, as winter sets in, millions of Afghans are awaiting relief assistance.
Iran has delivered fourteen rounds of aid to the people of Afghanistan since the Taliban takeover and a financial crisis in August.This comes as nearly 10 billion dollars in Afghan assets remain frozen by the US and a large number of funds to the country are halted.
Harsh winter in Afghanistan is worsening the dire situation, adding to the number of people in need.Most families are relying on such assistance because it is a matter of survival for them.
