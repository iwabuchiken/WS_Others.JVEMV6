Black Christians have a long history of radicalism.” 
Thus, the influence of an African religious orientation naturally led enslaved Africans to embrace Christianity as a weapon for liberation rather than believe claims that the faith justifies slavery.]]

After all, Mbiti points out that “…even if [in traditional African religions] God is thought to be the ultimate upholder of the moral order, people do not consider Him to be immediately involved in the keeping of it.” Consequently, enslaved Africans believed they had to take matters into their own hands if they wanted to be free.]]

Both Nat Turner and Denmark Vesey found in their Christian faith the inspiration to rise against their enslavers.]]

Vesey even organized his insurrection within the institutional framework of the African Methodist Episcopal Church.]]




Historian Sterling Stuckey described Vesey as “a sophisticated idealogue.”  Stuckey wrote: “Vesey promoted the use of radical Christianity and encouraged, through one of his lieutenants, its melding with African religious practices.]]

‘Beyond a general antiwhite attitude,’ [scholar Robert] Starobin writes, ‘Vesey combined the Old Testament’s harsh morality and the story of the Israelites with African religious customs.’ Indeed, Vesey used Christian radicalism to reinforce and rationalize his call to arms…” ]]

Turner and Vesey believed their white oppressors were as morally bankrupt and as irredeemable as the residents of Sodom and Gomorrah.

They likewise believed these enslavers deserved to suffer the same fate as their Old Testament counterparts.]]

Like Turner and Vesey, Dr.

Martin Luther King, Jr., was also a radical Christian, but his method presumed the white community retained a conscience that could be pricked and prodded into righteousness through his movement’s non-violent witnessing.]]
