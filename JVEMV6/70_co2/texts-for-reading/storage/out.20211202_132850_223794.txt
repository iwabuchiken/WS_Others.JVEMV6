As Yemenis celebrate Independence Day, the 'Aden Youth Movement' called for an uprising against the presence of the Saudi-led coalition's forces and those affiliated with the Hadi regime in the occupied city in southern Yemen.The movement denounced the deteriorating living condition caused by the continued collapse of the local currency.The US dollar's price has exceeded 1,600 riyals in the occupied areas compared to 600 riyals in the liberated ones.The devaluation of the local currency in the areas controlled by the Saudi-led coalition's forces has led to a surge in prices of basic commodities such as food and medicine.This has hampered daily life for people who are suffering from long-years of war.The depreciation of the local currency and the widespread poverty within the occupied southern areas have contributed to the growing public calls for the foreign forces withdrawal.People here in liberated areas believe that an armed struggle against the invaders is the only way out of the tragic situation in southern regions.]]Press TVâ€™s website can also be accessed at the following alternate addresses:
