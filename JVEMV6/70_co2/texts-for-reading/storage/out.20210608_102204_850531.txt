A conceptual difficulty in combining quantum mechanics with general relativity arises from the contrasting role of time within these two frameworks.]]In quantum theories time acts as an independent background through which states evolve, with the Hamiltonian operator acting as the generator of infinitesimal translations of quantum states through time.[26] ]]In contrast, general relativity treats time as a dynamical variable which relates directly with matter and moreover requires the Hamiltonian constraint to vanish.[27] ]]Because this variability of time has been observed macroscopically, ]] it removes any possibility of employing a fixed notion of time, similar to the conception of time in quantum theory, at the macroscopic level.]]
