Graviton Main article: Graviton The observation that all fundamental forces except gravity have one or more known messenger particles ]] leads researchers to believe that at least one must exist for gravity.]]This hypothetical particle is known as the graviton.]]These particles act as a force particle similar to the photon of the electromagnetic interaction.]]Under mild assumptions, the structure of general relativity requires them to follow the quantum mechanical description of interacting theoretical spin-2 massless particles.[12][13][14][15][16] ]] Many of the accepted notions of a unified theory of physics since the 1970s assume, and to some degree depend upon, the existence of the graviton.]]The Weinbergâ€“Witten theorem places some constraints on theories in which the graviton is a composite particle.[17][18] ]] While gravitons are an important theoretical step in a quantum mechanical description of gravity, they are generally believed to be undetectable because they interact too weakly.[19]]]
