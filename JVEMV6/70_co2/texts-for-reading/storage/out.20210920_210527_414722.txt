 In 2018, Palestinian prisoner Israa Jaabis appeared in court to appeal her sentence.Israa had been convicted of attempted murder — accused of blowing up her car near an Israeli military checkpoint — and sentenced to 11 years in 2016. The car accident left her completely disfigured, with first-, second- and third-degree burns on 50% of her body.“Is there a pain greater than this?” Israa asked the press during the court hearing.“The pain is visible, and I don’t receive treatment.”]]Now in 2021, Israa — still languishing in jail — has yet to receive several vital surgeries to ease her suffering. The #SaveIsraa campaignThis month, Israa’s family, activists, and former detainees renewed the campaign to raise international awareness of Israa’s case and pressure the Israeli government to provide the 37-year-old mother with appropriate medical treatment.Under the hashtag “SaveIsraa,” social media users lambasted Israel’s gross medical negligence.
