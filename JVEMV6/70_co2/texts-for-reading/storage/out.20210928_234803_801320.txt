APIB is a powerful unifying tool for the Indigenous peoples of the country.Indigenous Brazilians comprise a small fraction of Brazil’s population—about 900,000  Indigenous people survive today in a country of 211 million—yet they possess a profound human diversity in language and culture not seen in most modern countries.And they are now united in a common cause against Bolsonaro’s belligerence and the powerful forces that brought him into power.]]On August 9, APIB filed  a lawsuit in the International Criminal Court charging Bolsonaro with genocide.It’s the first time in the history of the ICC that the Indigenous people of the Western Hemisphere have defended themselves, with the help of Indigenous lawyers, against crimes against humanity in the Hague.“We have been fighting every day for hundreds of years to ensure our existence and today our fight for rights is global,” APIB’s executive director Sonia Guajajara said in a statement .A coalition of right-wing forces ranging from agribusinesses, the gun lobby, and evangelicals—collectively known as the “bull, bullet, and bible” bloc in parliament—is backing Bolsonaro’s project of destruction of the Amazon and its people.
