In the first comment I concluded that it appears difficult to claim that a blockade can be imposed legally in a non-international armed conflict (NIAC).]]However, I assume that a blockade in a NIAC can be lawful.]]Against this background, this comment assesses whether the coalition nevertheless obeyed the law of naval blockade and standards of international humanitarian law (IHL).]]The law of naval blockades derives from the 1856 Paris Declaration, the 1909 London Declaration and the 1994 San Remo Manual on International Law Applicable to Armed Conflicts at Sea (SRM), whereby the SRM reflects customary international law.]]In my view, this legal regime sets limits to blockading States to protect civil population and international shipping and it is basically applicable to international armed conflicts only.]]However, given the fact that States irrespective of the lawfulness conduct blockades in a NIAC, application of this protective regime, let it be by analogy, is without alternative â€“ a reasoning well known regarding the binding effects of IHL towards an aggressor.]]
