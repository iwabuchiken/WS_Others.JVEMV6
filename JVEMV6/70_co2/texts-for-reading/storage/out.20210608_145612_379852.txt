As was emphasized above, quantum gravitational effects are extremely weak and therefore difficult to test.]]For this reason, the possibility of experimentally testing quantum gravity had not received much attention prior to the late 1990s.]]However, in the past decade, physicists have realized that evidence for quantum gravitational effects can guide the development of the theory.]]Since theoretical development has ]] been slow, the field of phenomenological quantum gravity]], which studies the possibility of experimental tests, has obtained increased attention.[51].]]The most widely pursued possibilities for quantum gravity phenomenology include violations of Lorentz invariance, imprints of quantum gravitational effects in the cosmic microwave background (in particular its polarization), and decoherence induced by fluctuations[52].[53].[54].]]in the space-time foam.[55].]]ESA's INTEGRAL satellite measured polarization of photons of different wavelengths and was able to place a limit in the granularity of space [56].]]that is less than 10⁻⁴⁸m or 13 orders of magnitude below the Planck scale .]]The BICEP2 experiment detected what was initially thought to be primordial B-mode polarization caused by gravitational waves in the early universe.]]Had the signal in fact been primordial in origin, it could have been an indication of quantum gravitational effects, but it soon transpired that the polarization was due to interstellar dust interference.[57]. ]]
