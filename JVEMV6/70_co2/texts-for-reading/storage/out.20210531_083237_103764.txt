Lehava is not a registered charity in Israel so it can’t accept donations.Instead, money is funneled to Lehava through the Israeli nonprofit, the Foundation for the Salvation of the People of Israel, or Hakeren Lehazalat Am Israel in Hebrew.Israeli fund, Chemla or “mercy” in Hebrew has also been linked to Lehava until about 2014, according to HaBloc.
The Foundation for the Salvation of the People of Israel did not respond to requests for comment via email.The email address may be Gopstein’s as “benzion” is part of it.When contacted at the telephone number associated with the organization’s GuideStar (a nonprofit database) profile, the person said this was not the foundation and hung up.Contact information for Chemla is not publically available.
Two tax-exempt charities in the U.S.fund Kahanist activity in Israel: Charity of Light and the American Friends of Yeshivat HaRa’ayon HaYehudi.
Charity of Light funnels money to Chasdei Meir (which translates roughly into “charity which shines” in Hebrew).Chasdei Meir was named after Kahane, according to the fund’s website.As evidenced on Charity of Light’s tax returns, Chasdei Meir is related to the Chemla Fund.Charity of Light donated $72,000 to Chasdei Meir/Chemla Fund in 2018, according to its most recent tax filing.
