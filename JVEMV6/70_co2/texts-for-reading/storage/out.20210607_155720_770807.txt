General relativity, like electromagnetism, is a classical field theory.]]One might expect that, as with electromagnetism, the gravitational force should also have a corresponding quantum field theory.]]However, gravity is perturbatively nonrenormalizable.[4]]] :xxxvi–xxxviii;211–212[20] For a quantum field theory to be well defined according to this understanding of the subject, it must be asymptotically free or asymptotically safe.]]The theory must be characterized by a choice of finitely many parameters, which could, in principle, be set by experiment.]]For example, in quantum electrodynamics these parameters are the charge and mass of the electron, as measured at a particular energy scale.]]On the other hand, in quantizing gravity there are, in perturbation theory, infinitely many independent parameters (counterterm coefficients) needed to define the theory.]]For a given choice of those parameters, one could make sense of the theory, but since it is impossible to conduct infinite experiments to fix the values of every parameter, ]] it has been argued that one does not, in perturbation theory, have a meaningful physical theory.]]At low energies, the logic of the renormalization group tells us that, despite the unknown choices of these infinitely many parameters, quantum gravity will reduce to the usual Einstein theory of general relativity.]]On the other hand, if we could probe very high energies where quantum effects take over, then every one of the infinitely many unknown parameters would begin to matter, and we could make no predictions at all.[21]]
