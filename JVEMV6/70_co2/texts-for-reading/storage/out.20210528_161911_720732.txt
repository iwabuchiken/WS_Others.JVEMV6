Anecdotally, the same people in my own news feeds who were sharing black squares one year ago are now asking me for information about Palestine and are making, for the first time, a public display of outrage over the U.S.government’s material support of the occupation and their own complicity.One Instagram explainer  by a U.S.-based nonprofit stating, “What is happening in Palestine is not complicated; it’s settler colonialism” garnered half a million likes and was shared by former classmates from my high school in South Carolina—the same people who, when we were young, never acknowledged my family’s roots.
Beyond opening up new spaces for critique, this solidarity has also fostered more attention to how these technologies of oppression are not just operating in parallel but are intimately intertwined.Not only does the U.S.government give billions of dollars in military aid to Israel each year, but U.S.metropolitan police forces receive training in Israel .The same surveillance technologies  and security contractors engaged to quell protests in the U.S.are also used by the Israeli military.
It is tempting to feel overwhelmed in the face of these interlocking apparatuses of oppression.However, the recent vocal attention to the tactics of militarized police in both the U.S.and Israel has shown that just as the technologies of oppression grow increasingly linked, so too does the resistance to these forms of oppression.In an otherwise dark time and a seemingly endless conflict, for those of us watching and working from the sidelines, this change from Said’s words in 1993 is a source of hope and renewed action.
