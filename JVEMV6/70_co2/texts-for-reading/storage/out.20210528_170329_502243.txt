The industrial use of CO2 (see Section 7.3) as a gas or a liquid or as feedstock for the production of chemicals could contribute to keeping captured CO2  out of the atmosphere by storing it in anthropogenic carbon products.Industrial uses provide a carbon sink, as long as the pool size keeps growing and the lifetime of the compounds produced is long.Neither prerequisite is fulfilled in practice, since the scale of CO2 utilization is small compared to anthropogenic CO2  emissions, and the lifetime of the chemicals produced is too short with respect to the scale of interest in CO2  storage.Therefore, the contribution of industrial uses of captured CO2  to the mitigation of climate change is expected to be small.
