The controversial film offers insight into the crisis of the system but misses the mark in key areas.
A lively debate has ensued over the merits of the film, Don’t Look Up.People on the progressive side of the political spectrum have praised the film for its piercing honesty about the climate crisis which is communicated through the metaphor of an incoming, planet-destroying comet.In the film, establishment politicians and their corporate donors lack interest in the crisis and opportunistically search for ways to both avoid controversy and profit from it.The state is brutal toward those who speak out against powerful elites and is readily prepared to enact violence and/or sabotage against the people.Corporate celebrity and social media culture is highlighted as a powerful distraction which coerces the masses to “look down” rather than confront the pressing problems facing humanity.
It was inevitable that these elements of the film would make it a target of bad-faith criticism from the corporate media.Don’t Look Up has been subject to hostile critics seeking to delegitimize the film’s worldview.A CNN review unironically accuses the film of politicizing science and condemning the very people that need to be convinced about the climate crisis.The San Francisco Gate ignored the film’s metaphor for climate change and corporate destruction all together, arguing that the government could never keep a secret about a crisis so significant as a planet-destroying comet.MSNBC, to no one’s surprise, took issue with the film’s portrayal of the corporate media and its role in shifting attention away from the climate crisis at the behest of establishment politicians and corporations.
