Renormalization is a collection of techniques in quantum field theory, the statistical mechanics of fields, and the theory of self-similar geometric structures, that are used to treat infinities arising in calculated quantities by altering values of these quantities to compensate for effects of their self-interactions.But even if no infinities arose in loop diagrams in quantum field theory, it could be shown that it would be necessary to renormalize the mass and fields appearing in the original Lagrangian.[1] 
For example, an electron theory may begin by postulating an electron with an initial mass and charge.In quantum field theory a cloud of virtual particles, such as photons, positrons, and others surrounds and interacts with the initial electron.Accounting for the interactions of the surrounding particles (e.g.collisions at different energies) shows that the electron-system behaves as if it had a different mass and charge than initially postulated.Renormalization, in this example, mathematically replaces the initially postulated mass and charge of an electron with the experimentally observed mass and charge.Mathematics and experiments prove that positrons and more massive particles like protons, exhibit precisely the same observed charge as the electron - even in the presence of much stronger interactions and more intense clouds of virtual particles.
