The United States is increasingly using sanctions and economic warfare to hurt governments deemed to be adversaries.Some right-wing foreign policy advisors would like to amplify the economic damage to Nicaragua.Among them are some who would like to prevent the U.S.from importing beef from Nicaragua.
Cattle ranching is a major part of the economy in Nicaragua.Nicaragua once boasted large exports of beef to Venezuela, but with the extreme economic hardship in that country (attributable largely to U.S.sanctions), exports have declined, and Nicaragua has helped fill the gap by exporting larger quantities of high-quality beef to the United States.
Last October, PBS Newshour aired a nine-minute video about “Conflict Beef.” The documentary claimed that the increase in Nicaraguan beef exports is “coming at a high cost for indigenous communities that are being run off their land to make way for cattle ranches.” The accusation, and the suggestion that perhaps Nicaraguan beef should not be imported, was the video’s core message.
