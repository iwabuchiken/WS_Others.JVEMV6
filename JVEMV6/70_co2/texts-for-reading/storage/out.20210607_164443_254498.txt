It is conceivable that, ]] in the correct theory of quantum gravity, the infinitely many unknown parameters will reduce to a finite number that can then be measured.]]One possibility is that normal perturbation theory is not a reliable guide to the renormalizability of the theory, ]] and that there really is a UV fixed point for gravity.]]Since this is a question of non-perturbative quantum field theory, finding a reliable answer is difficult, pursued in the asymptotic safety program.]]Another possibility is that there are new, undiscovered symmetry principles ]] that constrain the parameters and reduce them to a finite set.]]This is the route taken by string theory, where all of the excitations of the string essentially manifest themselves as new symmetries.[22][better source needed] ]]
