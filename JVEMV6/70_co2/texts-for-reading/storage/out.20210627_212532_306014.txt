This is no doubt a solid reason why public health experts are not in an uproar about potential dangers from the mRNA vaccines, since they’re the most widely available in the United States and many other countries.]]This is especially true if you live in a country like the US, where now virtually every Covid-19 death is preventable with vaccination.With governments unlikely to reinstate social distancing measures when variant-driven cases swing up, getting inoculated is crucial to protecting your health.]]However, what I’m trying to say here is that when these arguments are only used to defend for-profit companies’ products, and thus help them profit even more, it reeks of corruption.]]This corruption becomes even more obvious when media outlets glorify Big Pharma, only to rediscover their critical faculties when they write about vaccines developed in countries like China, Russia, Iran or Cuba, as well as not-for-profit Western-developed vaccines like AstraZeneca or Johnson & Johnson.The fact is that the best vaccine is the one you have access to, therefore no vaccine should be getting biased coverage or attention from media outlets or government officials.Like this story?
