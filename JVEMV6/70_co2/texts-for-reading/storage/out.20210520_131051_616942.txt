CO2 biofixation by C.fusca LEB 111 in a medium containing industrial wastes such as SO2, NO and ash, can be explained by their morphology.This microalgal species is eucaryotic with their chlorophyll molecules organized into chloroplasts, unlike in prokaryotic microalgae, which contain chlorophyll in the cell membrane and in vesicular structures (chromophores).The level of Chlorella chloroplast membrane organization confers structural protection that may generate higher resistance to highly oxidative molecular species from the wastes present in flue gas (Tastan et al., 2012).
