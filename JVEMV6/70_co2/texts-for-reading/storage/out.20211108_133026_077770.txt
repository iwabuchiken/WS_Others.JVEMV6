An analyst has urged the international community not to merely condemn Israel’s settlement construction activities, but instead take action against the occupying regime, warning that any silence in this regard is a “black page” in history.Randa Farah, an Associate Professor at the Anthropology Department and Adjunct Faculty at the Centre for Global Studies at the University of Western Ontario, made the remarks on Saturday in an interview with Press TV.The remarks come as Israel moves forward with plans to build some 3,000 settler units in the occupied West Bank in defiance of global denunciations.]]She explained that Israel has never stopped its settler, colonial project and ethnic cleansing of the Palestinians since 1948, and even before then.“Israel is at it again, expanding its settlement on stolen Palestinian land,” she said.“The only thing that changes is the rhythm and scale of colonization.”     Farah also hailed growing international awareness of the realities on the ground in the occupied territories, adding, however, that “this is not enough, actions always speak louder than words.” ]]“It is totally unacceptable that in the 21st century, this scale and level of brutality against the Palestinians unleashed on a daily basis and for over seven decades is met with barely a whisper from the so-called ‘international community.’ The silence in the world is heard loudly in Palestine and is a black page in humanity’s history, and more so in the history of the Arab-Islamic world,” she said.
