Yemenis across the country have marked the seventh anniversary of a revolution they say ended the US hegemony in their country.]]

Tens of thousands rallied in the capital Sana’a as well as the northern city of Sa’ada and the western port city of Hudaydah to commemorate the revolution that took place on September 21, 2014, paving the way for the government of former President Abd-Rabbuh Mansur Hadi to collapse.




Protesters said the revolution was triggered by the Yemenis themselves without any foreign intervention, as a result of the deterioration of living conditions under the rule of the former president.




Hadi was backed by Saudi Arabia that even waged an ongoing war to reinstate him.

The Saudi-led war on the country has killed tens of thousands of civilians and displaced millions of others since 2015.




Yemenis say their revolution was aimed at preserving the sovereignty of their country, which was under the control of the US and Saudi proxies.

They believe that the Saudi brutal war on their country is the price for the freedom they have gained.
