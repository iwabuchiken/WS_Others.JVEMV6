The canonical version of the dynamics was established ]] by Thomas Thiemann, who defined an anomaly-free Hamiltonian operator and showed the existence of a mathematically consistent background-independent theory.]]The covariant, or "spin foam", version of the dynamics was developed jointly over several decades by research groups in France, Canada, UK, Poland, and Germany.]]It was completed in 2008, ]] leading to the definition of a family of transition amplitudes, ]] which in the classical limit can be shown to be related to a family of truncations of general relativity.[8].]]The finiteness of these amplitudes was proven in 2011.[9].[10].]]It requires the existence of a positive cosmological constant, which is consistent with observed acceleration in the expansion of the Universe.]]
