Despite this potential energy penalty, interest in mineral carbonation stems from two features that make it unique among the different storage approaches, namely the abundance of metal oxide bearing materials, particularly of natural silicates, and the permanence of storage of CO2  in a stable solid form.However, mineral carbonation is today still an immature technology.Studies reported in the literature have not yet reached a level where a thorough assessment of the technology, potential, costs and impacts is possible.
