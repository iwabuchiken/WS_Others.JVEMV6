LQG is formally background independent.]]The equations of LQG are not embedded in, or dependent on, space and time (except for its invariant topology).]]Instead, they are expected to give rise to space and time at distances which are 10 times the Planck length.]]The issue of background independence in LQG still has some unresolved subtleties.]]For example, some derivations require a fixed choice of the topology, while any consistent quantum theory of gravity should include topology change as a dynamical process.]]
