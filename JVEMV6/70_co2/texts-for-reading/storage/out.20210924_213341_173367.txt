A pattern of medical negligence 
Activists and human rights organizations assert that Israel is deliberately neglecting Israa’s fragile health.

Anat Litvin, director of the prisoners and detainees department at Physicians for Human Rights-Israel (PHRI), told MintPress that while Israa’s condition hasn’t worsened since her arrest, her injuries still need ongoing treatment and maintenance.

“You need to treat the damaged area over the years because otherwise the tissue grows too fast and scars,” Litvin said.]]




According to Milena Ansari, the international advocacy officer at Addameer Prisoner Support and Human Rights Association, the Israel Prison Service (IPS) provides Israa only with painkillers in lieu of actual treatment.




This is all part of the deliberate medical neglect policy that the Israeli occupation uses,” Ansari said.

“They don’t feel like they have [an] obligation toward Palestinian detainees and prisoners regarding their health care.” 
PHRI was in contact with the IPS to set up Israa’s surgeries, but the process is now at an impasse as the IPS hasn’t paid the hospital yet for the operations.

The PHRI appealed to the Nazareth District Court two weeks ago over the issue and is awaiting a response.

IPS did not respond to a request for comment.
