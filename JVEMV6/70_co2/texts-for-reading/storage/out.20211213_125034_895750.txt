The Palestinian Ma'an news agency reported the atrocity on Monday, identifying the victim as a young male, who lost his life during a raid by the forces at Nablus' Old City.
Reuters referred to the Israeli assailants as the regime's "paramilitary border police said undercover forces." 
The agency claimed that the fatality was caused, when the forces confronted Palestinians, who were "hurling explosive devices" at the forces.
It also alleged that the skirmish erupted after the forces hunted down a "wanted" Palestinian.
The Palestinian resistance movement of the Islamic Jihad mourned the youth's martyrdom in a statement, but did not identify him as one of its members.
Also on Monday, Israeli forces assaulted the al-Ain refugee camp in Nablus as well as the city of Bethlehem in the west-central part of the West Bank.
Israeli forces fired teargas canisters to disperse the Palestinians during the latter raid.
The developments come only two days after Israeli troops killed a young Palestinian and injured as many as 68 others, attacking the southern part of Nablus.Israeli forces kill young Palestinian in Nablus Israeli forces kill young Palestinian in Nablus The Palestinian Health Ministry said the young man succumbed to injuries he sustained on Sobeih Mountain in Beita, south of Nablus City.
