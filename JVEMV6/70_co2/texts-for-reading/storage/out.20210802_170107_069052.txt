France is not removing all its troops, and the country’s interest in Africa has not evaporated.” 
There may nevertheless be reasons to be encouraged by these developments.

Notwithstanding the fact that imperialist governments are chronically stuck on stupid when it comes to using armed force to impose their will in underdeveloped regions, there is ever-diminishing patience and tolerance for such activities among the broad masses of people in France, the U.S.

and other western countries when the cost of these operations is the deaths of soldiers.

The U.S.

government felt pressure from its own citizens when four soldiers were killed in Niger in 2017. France is now feeling heat because of deaths of its soldiers.




The public pressure triggered by military casualties may not signal significant growth of revolutionary consciousness, but it does have a limiting effect that is useful to those resisting the militarization of Africa.]]

It even presents for Africans born and living in imperialist countries the best opportunities to fight for Africa by taking advantage of direct access to those who can, through force of mass movement end the militarization of the continent.

Africa’s potential for using its resources to save not only itself, but its diaspora can’t be realized until the imperialist combat-booted foot on the continent’s neck is removed.
