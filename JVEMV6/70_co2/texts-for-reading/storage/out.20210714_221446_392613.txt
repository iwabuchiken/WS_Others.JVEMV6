Amawi said that her grandmother fell ill after learning of the auction.“She got sick.She had a fever and she was really, really sad because to her, this is where she grew up.This is where her earliest memories are and this is where she has the right to be,” Amawi said.Stone houses like the one Odeh spent his early childhood in now crumble from neglect.The walls are sprayed with graffiti and piles of trash line the floors.On Shabbat (the Jewish sabbath), you’ll often find Israelis bathing in the spring’s waters.Aseel AlBajeh, advocacy officer and legal researcher at the Palestinian human rights organization Al-Haq, visited Lifta in 2018. Her grandmother, who lives in Ramallah, is from Lifta.“It was a painful experience,” AlBajeh said of her time in Lifta.“I wasn’t sure if I wanted to come back to Lifta in this situation.”   ‘You are here as a visitor’ During her visit, AlBajeh tried recalling her grandmother’s memories of a flourishing Lifta, but ]] she said those stories were disrupted by the fact that she’s only in Lifta because of a permit she received from the Israeli government to enter 1948-occupied Palestine or modern-day Israel from the West Bank.]]“You are here as a visitor.It’s like it’s not a place where you belong, or this is what [the Israeli government] intends for refugees to feel like,” AlBajeh said.“Settlers were swimming in the spring of the village and they were blasting loud music, and it also disrupted my ability to even imagine Lifta as Palestinian.”
