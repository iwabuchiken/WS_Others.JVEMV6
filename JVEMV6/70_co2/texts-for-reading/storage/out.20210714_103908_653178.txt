Renaud spoke of how prisons force incarcerated laborers to work any type of job assigned to them, and how protesting such work will inevitably lead to being assigned “more brutal jobs, more degrading jobs until you finally end up in solitary confinement.]][Then] you don’t have to work but now you’re in there with nothing: no privileges, no commissary, no visitation, no nothing.” ]]The inclusion of the “slavery clause” made the passage of restrictions targeting Black people like the Black Codes possible as well as convict leasing of the late 19th century.]]It’s important not to erase the unique horrors faced by those who were enslaved and those who are currently or formerly incarcerated, but the fact is that the “slavery clause” helped enable the current system of prison labor where incarcerated people are forced to work for both the state as well as private companies for little to no pay.
