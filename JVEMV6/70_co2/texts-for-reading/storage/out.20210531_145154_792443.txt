Serpentine and olivine are mainly found in ophiolite belts – geological zones where colliding continental plates lead to an uplifting of the earth’s crust (Coleman 1977).For example, considering ultramafic deposits containing serpentine and olivine in the Eastern United States and in Puerto Rico, it was found that they have RCO2 values between 1.97 and 2.51, depending on purity and type (the RCO2 is the ratio of the mass of mineral needed to the mass of CO2 fixed when assuming complete conversion of the mineral upon carbonation, that is the reciprocal of the theoretical CO2 storage capacity introduced above).Peridotites and serpentinites exceed the total Mg requirement to neutralize the CO2 from all worldwide coal resources estimated at 10,000 Gt (Lackner et al., 1995).Specific ore deposits identified in two studies in the USA and Puerto Rico add to approximately 300GtCO2 (Goff and Lackner, 1998; Goff et al., 2000).This should be compared to CO2  emissions of about 5.5 GtCO2  in the United States and about 24 GtCO2 /yr-1 worldwide.No comprehensive mapping of the worldwide storage potential in ophiolite belts has been reported.However, their total surface exposure is estimated to be of the order of 1000 km by 100 km (Goff et al., 2000).It is well known however that magnesium silicate reserves are present in all continents, but since they tend to follow present or ancient continental boundaries, they are not present in all countries.The feasibility of their use for ex-situ or in-situ mineral carbonation is yet to be established (Brownlow, 1979; Newall et al., 2000).	 On a smaller-scale, industrial wastes and mining tailings provide sources of alkalinity that are readily available and reactive.Even though their total amounts are too small to substantially reduceCO2  emissions, they could help introduce the technology.Waste streams of calcium silicate materials that have been considered for mineral carbonation include pulverized fuel ash from coal fired power plants (with a calcium oxide content up to 65% by weight), bottom ash (about 20% by weight CaO) and fly ash (about 35% by weight CaO) from municipal solid waste incinerators, de-inking ash from paper recycling (about 35% by weight CaO), stainless steel slag (about 65% by weight CaO and MgO) and waste cement (Johnson, 2000; Fernández Bertos et al., 2004; Iizuka et al., 2004).
