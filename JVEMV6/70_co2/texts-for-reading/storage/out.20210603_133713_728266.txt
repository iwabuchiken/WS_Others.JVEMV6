The Methanol to Hydrocarbons process was discovered at Mobil Oil in 1977. This process is used to convert methanol to products such as olefins and gasoline.The methanol can first be obtained from coal or natural gas.In the Methanol to Olefins (MTO) process, the methanol is then converted to olefins such as ethylene and propylene.The olefins can be reacted to produce polyolefins, which are used to make many plastic materials.An MTO process flow diagram advertised by Honeywell is shown below.
