A revolving door of employees serves Amazon’s needs quite nicely.” 
The algorithm hirings and firings and the facial recognition technology problems are not bugs in the system.They are features.They are doing precisely what they are intended to do, keep workers poor, desperate, and at the mercy of capitalists.Cruelty is the point.
One might ask who speaks for the people.Workers in several states had their unemployment saved by court decisions but those are few and far between.Politicians are as blatant as their corporate bosses and openly side with them against their constituents. 
There is no way to reform this system.Democrats and republicans are equally eager to act at the behest of corporate interests.The people either vote in hopes of change that never comes or are apathetic because they see that the odds are against them. 
The workers who refuse low pay under dangerous conditions are moving in the right direction.Whether they know it or not they are potentially building a new movement.A general strike is what the country needs.Of course that is why the hammer fell in an attempt to nip any resistance in the bud and get the cogs back into the machine.But the direction we must move in is clear.There is no salvation from a Biden or a Harris or any other name being floated.The people will have to move in a different direction if they are to save themselves.
