US targets humanitarian mission 
Special Envoy and Ambassador to the African Union for Venezuela Alex Saab was on a humanitarian mission flying from Caracas to Iran to procure food and gasoline for the Venezuelan CLAP food assistance program.Saab was detained on a refueling stop in the African nation of Cabo Verde and has been held in custody ever since June 12, 2020.
Saab’s “crime” — according to the U.S.government, which ordered the imprisonment — was money laundering.That is, Saab conducted perfectly legal international trade.Still, his circumventing of the U.S.sanctions – which are designed to prevent relief to the Venezuelans – is considered by Washington to be money laundering.
After a two-year investigation into Saab’s transactions with Swiss banks, the Swiss government concluded on March 25 that there was no money laundering.Saab is being prosecuted because he is serving his country’s interest rather than that of the U.S.Saab was born in Colombia but now holds Venezuelan citizenship.
The U.S.mandate for the arrest and extradition of Saab would be like Saudi Arabia demanding the arrest and extradition of a British citizen visiting Italy for wearing short-shorts.In essence, the U.S.does not have legal jurisdiction over a Venezuelan in Cabo Verde on his way to Iran.
As former Venezuelan minister and activist Indhriana Parada wrote in the Alliance for Global Justice webinar chat: “Greetings from Venezuela.We support the release of Alex Saab.It is a totally political case, and we want him back.Alex Saab did not launder money.Alex Saab bought food and medicine for Venezuela.” 
The legal fig leaf for what amounts to a kidnapping was an INTERPOL “red notice,” which was not issued until a day after Saab’s arrest and was subsequently dropped.Saab has stated specifically: 
    They tortured me and pressured me to sign voluntary extradition declarations and bear false witness against my government.”
