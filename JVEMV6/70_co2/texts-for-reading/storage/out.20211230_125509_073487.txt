With almost a week to the second anniversary of assassination of General Qassem Soleimani, Iran has held a meeting to discuss the legal aspects of his assassination and what has already been done to bring the main perpetrators of his terror to justice.]]Addressing the meeting which was held at Islamic Azad University in Varamin-Pishva southeast of Tehran province, the deputy head of Iran’s human rights council for international affairs, Majid Tafreshi, said Iran is still seriously following up the legal aspect of General Soleimani’s assassination.General Soleimani was assassinated in a US drone strike near Baghdad’s airport on January 2, 2020 upon direct order by then US President Donald Trump.During the terrorist attack, Iraq’s PMU deputy commander Abu Mahadi al-Mandis and a number of bodyguards were also martyred.Meanwhile, Iran’s human rights chief Kazem Gharibabadi announced that the Iranian Judiciary has submitted a 300-page document on the terror attack against Qassem Soleimani by the United States to the Iraqi side.Gharibabadi said the document was prepared after talks between the first joint research committee meetings between Iran and Iraq in Baghdad and Tehran.General Soleimani is known in the region as the spearhead of the fight against terrorism.That's why, as analysts say, his assassination came as a huge loss for the region and a big win for the terrorists, something which led to a safe interpretation that Washington must be on the terrorists' side.Two years after the assassination of General Qassem Soleimani, he still serves as a role model for freedom seekers around the world and his legacy of resistance will remain in history for good.Press TV’s website can also be accessed at the following alternate addresses:
