IRS charity law states that terrorist activities are considered substantial means for disqualifying an organization’s tax-exempt status.This is in accordance with engaging in illegal acts contrary to standard U.S.policy.A litany of private foundations supports the CFI.Most notably, the foundations belonging to the late American billionaires Sheldon Adelson and Irving Moskowitz.The Moskowitz family foundations have contributed more than $8 million to CFI since 2018 and Adelson’s foundation gave $50,000 to CFI in 2018.Jay Marcus of CFl said in a statement to MintPress News that, “The Central Fund of Israel absolutely rejects violence and does not support any organizations that promote violence.Furthermore, if an organization that we once supported ever started promoting violence, CFI would not support them in the future.”Marcus claims that he hasn’t heard of Lehava, adding, “having had rockets indiscriminately showered down on my head, I would certainly disagree with your myth about which ‘groups start violence.’”The Falic family, owners of the major retail chain Duty Free Americas, has supported The Fund for Saving the People of Israel in the past, providing a total of $60,000 to the association from 2007-2017. The money is wired through the Falic’s Israel-based foundation, the Segal Fund.The Falics could not be reached for comment.
