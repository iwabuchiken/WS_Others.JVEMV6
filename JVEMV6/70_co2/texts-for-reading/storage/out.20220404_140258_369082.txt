It was a day of high drama and surprises in Pakistan.The country’s Parliament was to vote on a no trust move against Prime Minister Imran Khan.
But the deputy speaker blocked the vote by ruling that the opposition's move was part of an international conspiracy against the government.Within minutes Prime Minister Khan appeared on national television and announced the Parliament was dissolved. 
Khan claims he was being ousted from power by the US for pursuing independent foreign policy.But opposition parties have rejected the move and termed it a violation of the Constitution.Khan came to power in 2018 and promised to bring reforms in the country.
The opposition accused him of failing to deliver on his promise and wanted him gone.But the speaker's move to reject the opposition's vote of no confidence motion has triggered a constitutional crisis in the country.
The focus has now shifted from Parliament to the Supreme Court of Pakistan.The country’s highest court will decide whether the speaker’s ruling and subsequent decision by the prime minister to dissolve the Parliament is constitutional or not.
