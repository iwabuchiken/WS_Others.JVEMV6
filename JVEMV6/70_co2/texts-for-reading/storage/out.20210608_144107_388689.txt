The theory is based on the reformulation of general relativity known as ]] Ashtekar variables,]] which represent geometric gravity using mathematical analogues of electric and magnetic fields.[37].[38]. ]]In the quantum theory, space is represented by a network structure called a spin network, evolving over time in discrete steps.[39].[40].[41].[42]. ]]The dynamics of the theory is today constructed in several versions.]]One version starts with the canonical quantization of general relativity.]]The analogue of the Schrödinger equation is a Wheeler–DeWitt equation, which can be defined within the theory.[43]. ]]In the covariant, or spinfoam formulation of the theory, the quantum dynamics is obtained via a sum over discrete versions of spacetime, called spinfoams.]]These represent histories of spin networks.
