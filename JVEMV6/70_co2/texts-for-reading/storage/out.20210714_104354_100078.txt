The phenomenon reminded Renaud of the separation between enslaved people working in the house versus the field.It also serves as a reminder that in addition to the loss of wages and the strain that places on families who are now tasked with financially supporting their incarcerated loved ones, prison labor also fails to provide jobs that can translate into careers upon release.]] “Black and Latinx people are often assigned to more custodial positions while their white peers are more likely to get technical skills.“ Even jobs that could lead to fruitful careers, such as positions in California’s Conservation Camps where incarcerated people fight fires alongside local and state fire departments, are rife with inequity.]]In addition to not earning anything close to the wages enjoyed by their free world counterparts, incarcerated firefighters are often barred from continuing this work upon their release because of restrictions in getting their license due to their past conviction.]]For Michael Mendoza, director of national advocacy for the Anti-Recidivism Coalition, this profoundly stifles people’s ability to reshape their lives. “When we talk about jobs in prison,” Mendoza said, “We’re talking about jobs that don’t lead to actual careers because of these exceptions and these laws that we desperately need to change.” ]]
