In general relativity, general covariance is ]] intimately related to "diffeomorphism invariance".]]This symmetry is one of the defining features of the theory.]]However, it is a common misunderstanding that "diffeomorphism invariance" refers to the invariance of the physical predictions of a theory under arbitrary coordinate transformations; this is untrue and in fact every physical theory is invariant ]] under coordinate transformations this way.]]Diffeomorphisms, as mathematicians define them,]] correspond to something much more radical; intuitively a way they can be envisaged is as simultaneously dragging all the physical fields (including the gravitational field) over the bare differentiable manifold while staying in the same coordinate system.]]Diffeomorphisms are the true symmetry transformations of general relativity,]] and come about from the assertion that the formulation of the theory is based on a bare differentiable manifold, but not on any prior geometry â€” the theory is background-independent ]] (this is a profound shift, as all physical theories before general relativity had as part of their formulation a prior geometry).]]What is preserved under such transformations are the coincidences between the values the gravitational field takes at such and such a "place" and the values the matter fields take there.]]From these relationships one can form a notion of matter being located with respect to the gravitational field, or vice versa.]]This is what Einstein discovered: that physical entities are located with respect to one another only and not with respect to the spacetime manifold.]]As Carlo Rovelli puts it: "No more fields on spacetime: just fields on fields".[11].]]This is the true meaning of the saying "The stage disappears and becomes one of the actors"; space-time as a "container" over which physics takes place ]] has no objective physical meaning and instead the gravitational interaction is represented as just one of the fields forming the world.]]This is known as the relationalist interpretation of space-time.]]The realization by Einstein that general relativity should be interpreted this way is the origin of his remark "Beyond my wildest expectations".]]
