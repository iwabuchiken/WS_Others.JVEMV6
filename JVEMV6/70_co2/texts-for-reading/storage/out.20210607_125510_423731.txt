Renormalization specifies relationships between parameters in the theory when parameters describing large distance scales differ from parameters describing small distance scales.]]Physically, the pileup of contributions from an infinity of scales involved in a problem may then result in further infinities.]]When describing space-time as a continuum, ]] certain statistical and quantum mechanical constructions are not well-defined.]]To define them, or make them unambiguous, a continuum limit must carefully remove "construction scaffolding" of lattices at various scales.]]Renormalization procedures are based on the requirement that certain physical quantities (such as the mass and charge of an electron) equal observed (experimental) values.]]That is, the experimental value of the physical quantity yields practical applications, ]] but due to their empirical nature the observed measurement represents areas of quantum field theory]] that require deeper derivation from theoretical bases.
