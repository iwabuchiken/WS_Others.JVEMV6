Mbiti goes on to say: 
“It is not enough to embrace a faith which is confined to a church building or mosque, which is locked up six days and opened only once or twice a week.]]

Unless Christianity and Islam fully occupy the whole person as much as, if not more than, traditional [African] religions do, most [African] converts to these faiths will continue to revert to their old beliefs and practices for perhaps six days a week, and certainly in times of emergency and crisis.”]]
