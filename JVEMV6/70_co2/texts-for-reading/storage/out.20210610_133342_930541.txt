In LQG this aspect of general relativity is ]] taken seriously and this symmetry is preserved by requiring that the physical states remain invariant under the generators of diffeomorphisms.]]The interpretation of this condition is well understood for purely spatial diffeomorphisms.]]However, the understanding of diffeomorphisms involving time (the Hamiltonian constraint)]] is more subtle because it is related to dynamics and the so-called "problem of time" in general relativity.[12].]]A generally accepted calculational framework to account for this constraint has yet to be found.[13].[14].]]A plausible candidate for the quantum Hamiltonian constraint is the operator introduced by Thiemann.[15].]]
