For socialists, however, it is time to intervene in life.We are going through a period in which the economic crisis impoverishes the workers like a streak.Dissatisfaction is getting more and more intense.There are millions who cannot pay their rents, electricity and gas bills, loan installments and are depressed due to unemployment and lack of money.The facts that we easily touch upon here are the tragedies of individuals.To cut a long story short, socialists must find ways to intervene in life.]]For example, there is a terrible increase in house rents, especially in big cities.So much so that rents have doubled in some areas.The rental price of a proper house, even in laborer districts in big cities, reached the limit of 2000 TL ( 2/3 of the minimum wage).]]And yet, can’t socialists lead strong actions in these neighborhoods fueled by effective campaigns against exorbitant prices? It is imperative that a response be given to the mismanagement of the AKP government, which is rapidly impoverishing the workers.This issue is not something to be glossed over with statements made from parliamentary rostrums, TV channels, or social media.We need class war, not word war.In other words, protests should rise from the workers’ side against the economic crisis.If this happens, the AKP will be in a very difficult situation.If the urban poor takes to the streets against the high cost of living and unemployment, the AKP will get into a scrape.Beyond the AKP, the workers will have won a golden victory against the capitalist system.
