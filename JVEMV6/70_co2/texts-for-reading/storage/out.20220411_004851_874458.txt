Increase in kidnappings widens the strike to other health workers 
Gang violence, especially kidnappings, has represented a particularly serious problem throughout the year.According to a UN report  issued in February 2022, there has been a 180% percent increase in kidnappings in 2021 compared to the previous year: at least 655 people have been reported kidnapped by gangs, and the real number is expected to be even higher than that.Health workers themselves have been targeted by gangs, with two of them – physicians Pierre Boncy and Michel D’Alexis – being kidnapped at the beginning of March 2022.
The rising insecurity has been another reason for health workers outside the hospital system to protest.From 14 to 16 March, health workers staged a 3-day strike focusing specifically on this issue.Professional associations have warned the government that protecting health workers is essential if they want them to be able to provide care for patients.During a press conference where the strike was announced, Osni Eugène, vice-president of the Haitian Medical Association, stated: “The medical sector is taking a beating these days.If we don’t make our voices heard, I feel the situation in the country will worsen because we live in a country where many people perish because of stress, food insecurity…” 
Health workers and trade unions agree that it will be impossible to resolve the situation if the MoH does not change its approach to the health system.Both groups are insisting that – instead of offering short-term and harm-reduction measures for problems that have developed after years of inadequate funding – the ministry should allocate more resources for the public health system, and invest their efforts to build a safe and effective health system.
