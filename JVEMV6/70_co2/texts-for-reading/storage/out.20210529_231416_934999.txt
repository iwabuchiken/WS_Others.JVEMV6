Ranking 175th and 185th among the world’s countries in terms of geographic area and economic size respectively, resource-poor, and dependent on tourism and remittances from abroad, the Republic of Cabo Verde is vulnerable to U.S.strong-arm tactics.Shortly after Saab’s arrest, the U.S.gifted $1.5 million to private sector entities in Cabo Verde on top of some $284 million total U.S.aid in the last 20 years.
The U.S.State Department describes Cabo Verde as “an important partner” where the “current administration has prioritized relations with the United States and Europe.” The U.S.Bureau for International Narcotics Law Enforcement funds and supports activities in Cabo Verde, while the Boston Police Department works with Cabo Verde police.
Cabo Verde, it should be noted, is important in the history of African liberation.Marxist Amílcar Cabral led the liberation movement of Guinea-Bissau and Cabo Verde Islands and was assassinated in 1973, only months before it declared independence from Portugal.
