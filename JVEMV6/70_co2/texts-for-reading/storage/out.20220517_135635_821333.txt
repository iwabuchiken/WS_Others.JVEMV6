Amid the outpouring of grief and shock over the Saturday mass shooting in Buffalo, New York, Black residents express anguish about the racism and white supremacy that fueled the deadliest massacre in modern American history.
Protesters rallied at a Black Lives Matter demonstration on Sunday in Buffalo, a day after an alleged white supremacist sympathizer shot and killed 10 people at a supermarket that largely served African Americans.
The demonstrators aired grievances about their communities being forgotten by authorities on the largely impoverished East Side.They called on politicians to direct more resources to protect Buffalo’s Black residents, whose lives and sense of security have long been disturbed by racism and gun violence.
“We don’t want to be protected after the fact,” Marlene Brown, a 58-year-old Black resident, told The New York Times.For more than a decade she has lived just blocks away from the Tops supermarket, where the gunman shot 13 people, 11 of whom Blacks, in what authorities said was a racially-motivated mass shooting.
