Nicaragua is a good example.For historical and contemporary reasons, Washington is hostile to the Nicaraguan government.The Sandinista Front ousted the country’s U.S.-backed dictator in 1979 and governed until 1990. Then, following a decade of U.S.-sponsored “Contra” war and economic sanctions, the Sandinistas were voted out of office.After 16 years of neoliberal governments, the Nicaraguan people voted to return the Sandinistas to power in 2006. In 2011, the Sandinista Front (FSLN) won the election again and in 2016 secured a staggering 73% of the vote.
Nicaragua has a capitalist economy, but the government provides many social services, including health care and education, along with community-based policing and an impressive 90% food self-sufficiency.Nicaragua maintains an independent foreign policy that sometimes aligns with Cuba, Venezuela, and other independent movements in Latin America.The country has also made plans for a trans-oceanic canal.Washington disapproves because this would compete with the Panama Canal and be independent of heavy U.S.influence.With the financial collapse of the canal’s Chinese investor, the plans have been suspended if not canceled.Regardless of whether the plan is implemented, the U.S.foreign policy establishment and associated media have been hostile to the Nicaraguan government for daring to even conceive of the project.
