One of the difficulties of formulating a quantum gravity theory is that quantum gravitational effects only appear at length scales near the Planck scale, around 10âˆ’35 meters, a scale far smaller, and hence only accessible with far higher energies, than those currently available in high energy particle accelerators.Therefore, physicists lack experimental data which could distinguish between the competing theories which have been proposed[n.b.1][n.b.2] and thus thought experiment approaches are suggested as a testing tool for these theories.[6][7][8]
