In this example of nearly identical  draconian and inhumane approaches to immigration policy met with wildly different receptions from the masses, we can see both the strategy and the impact of capitalism-imperialism’s weaponization of empathy.How, when we are not politically educated, our sense of care and concern for the conditions of other living beings can be manipulated and deployed at the whims of the ruling class using their massive media monopolies.It’s not that people stopped caring about kids being put in cages, families being separated, and infants being deported without caretakers, it’s that our awareness of these issues is determined by the visibility the ruling class chooses to give them within the media we consume.They can turn that awareness off and turn it on and they can point it wherever they want to.This is why the spectacle around immigration stopped as soon as Biden entered office.This is also why even at the height of the outrage, mainstream media analysis of the cruelty of US immigration policy under Trump never got into the real reasons  why so many people were fleeing their homes for the US border.Doing so would have required implicating US imperialism and no one on TV was trying to do that. 
The ruling class propaganda apparatus depends on the cynical manipulation of our emotions and the weaponization of our empathy, it also depends on obscuring political and historical context in order to manufacture consent for imperialism.Another recent example which illustrates this clearly is the US and NATO’s proxy war in Ukraine.
