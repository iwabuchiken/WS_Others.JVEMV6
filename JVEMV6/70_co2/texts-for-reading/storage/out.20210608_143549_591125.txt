Loop quantum gravity seriously considers general relativity's insight that spacetime is a dynamical field ]] and is therefore a quantum object.]]Its second idea is that the quantum discreteness that determines the particle-like behavior of other field theories (for instance, the photons of the electromagnetic field) also affects the structure of space.]]The main result of loop quantum gravity is the derivation of a granular structure of space at the Planck length.]]This is derived from following considerations: In the case of electromagnetism, the quantum operator representing the energy of each frequency of the field has a discrete spectrum.]]Thus the energy of each frequency is quantized, and the quanta are the photons.]]In the case of gravity, the operators representing the area and the volume of each surface or space region likewise have discrete spectrum.]]Thus area and volume of any portion of space are also quantized, where the quanta are elementary quanta of space.]]It follows, then, that spacetime has an elementary quantum granular structure at the Planck scale, which cuts off the ultraviolet infinities of quantum field theory.]]The quantum state of spacetime is described in the theory by means of a mathematical structure called spin networks.]]Spin networks were initially introduced by Roger Penrose in abstract form, and later shown by Carlo Rovelli and Lee Smolin to derive naturally from a non-perturbative quantization of general relativity.]]Spin networks do not represent quantum states of a field in spacetime: they represent directly quantum states of spacetime.]]
