Radmann et al.(2011) cultivated Chlorella vulgaris with injection of 12% (v v−1) CO2, 60 ppm SO2 and 100 ppm NO in a serial tubular bioreactor at 0.3 vvm, and the CO2 biofixation efficiency obtained was 13.43% (w w−1), which was 4 times lower than that found in this study with C.fusca LEB 111 under similar conditions (experiment 1).Combined with the use of a closed photobioreactor, low-flow injection of the gases used in the present study (0.05 vvm) allows a higher residence time of the gases in liquid medium without a severe environmental loss and, therefore, greater CO2 biofixation efficiency by the microalga.
Chiu et al.(2011) cultivated Chlorella sp.MTF-25 using 25% CO2, 90 ppm SO2 and 80 ppm NO injected into the cultures at 0.05 vvm and obtained an approximate 60% (w w−1) biofixation efficiency, higher than in the present study.High concentrations of CO2 in the medium can intensify the carboxylase activity of RuBisCO (Ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase) and, therefore, increase the photosynthetic efficiency and resultant microalgal CO2 biofixation.The variation of the pH between 8.0 and 10.8 during the experiments favored the activity of RuBisCO, which is responsible for CO2 biofixation in the Calvin cycle and activated under alkaline conditions.This may explain the high rates of C.fusca LEB 111 CO2 biofixation under all conditions analyzed.
Under unfavorable circumstances, cultures can suffer microalgal cell stress and thus produce more carbohydrate and lipid.Carbohydrate concentrations (Table 3) in the C.fusca LEB 111 biomass ranged from 18.8 ± 1.1 to 20.7 ± 1.1% (w w−1).This macromolecule concentrations in the biomass obtained in the experiments 1, 2, 3 and 5 were statistically equal (p > 0.10) to the control.Therefore, the growth conditions of C.fusca LEB 111 were not stressful to the microalgal cells.These macromolecules present in the C.fusca LEB 111 biomass may have various applications, especially as an alternative renewable raw material for bioethanol production.The advantage of producing this biofuel from microalgal biomass is the absence of lignin in the cells, facilitating the cellulose microalgal enzymatic hydrolysis (Singh and Olsen, 2011).
