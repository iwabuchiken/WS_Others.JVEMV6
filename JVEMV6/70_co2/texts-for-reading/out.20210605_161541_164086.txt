The process proposed here produces hydrocarbons or syn-gas through the electrochemicalreduction of CO2. The cell consists of two sections, the anode and the cathode.Water is fed into theanode, where it is split into O2 gas and hydrogen ions.The balanced anodic reaction isThe ions are transported by solution through the membrane and into the cathode.These ions thenreact with the CO2 gas which is fed into the cathode, generally producing water and some form ofreduced carbon product.A variety of products can be produced, though few experiments haveproduced notable amounts of species longer than one or two carbons in length.The most commonreduction products have been carbon monoxide, methane, ethylene, methanol, and formic acid.Hydrogen can also be produced, though it is not desired in this situation as will be explained below.Thetypical cathodic reactions are listed here.
