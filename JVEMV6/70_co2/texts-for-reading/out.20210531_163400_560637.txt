Serpentine can take many different forms, from decorative stones to chrysotile asbestos (O’Hanley, 1996).The possibility of encountering asbestos requires adequate precautions.With current best practice it would reportedly not be an obstacle(Newall et al., 2000).Moreover, since the asbestos form of serpentine is the most reactive, reaction products are expected to be asbestos free (O’Connor et al., 2000).Mineral carbonation could therefore remediate large natural asbestos hazards that occur in certain areas, in California for example (Nichols, 2000).
