II.Overview of MTO Mechanism 
The conversion of methanol to olefins on acidic zeolites takes place through a complex network of chemical reactions.The distribution of products and thus the “selectivity” depends on the temperature, among other factors.Selectivity is a measure of the amount of one product produced relative to others when the possibility to form multiple products exists.Selectivity depends on temperature through the Arrhenius law for the different rate constants.
In general, at lower temperatures methanol reacts to form dimethyl ether (DME).At higher temperatures, the desired products (olefins) are produced and the selectivity for DME decreases.Typical percent yields at steady state for methanol conversion on the zeolite H-SAPO-34 are shown below.“Steady-state” refers to a process in which the properties, such as temperature or concentrations, are not changing with time.The percent conversion of methanol is denoted by Xme and the Y terms represent percent yields.The subscript dme refers to dimethyl ether.The subscripts C2=, C3=, C4= and C4 refer to ethylene, propylene, butylenes, and butane, respectively.Based on the yield curves, the temperature at which the olefin products are first observed is near 523 K for H-SAPO-34.
